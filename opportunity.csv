1,"37), allows us to create a very attractive entry point, and profitability for most of these even reduced reimbursement levels that we're currently seeing across the world. So, customers are seeing the QIAGEN GeneReader solution as an answer to some of their issues and not simply adding to their issues that they're already seeing today."
1,"38) negotiation we're going through right now with this one particular team. We think Philadelphia has a significant opportunity for our unique business model, and we want to take advantage of that."
1,"39) $25 million upfront, and then a very significant royalty rate. So, it really allows us to fund the expansion of our therapeutic pipeline in future years."
1,"4 billion, or about 5% of all commissions. We see significant opportunity to expand our addressable market over the long term. As we dive deeper in the funnel we see more opportunity to increase the number of transactions and commissions to our partners."
1,"4 million units. We believe that our brand exposure combined with the improved performance of our recent acquisitions will allow us to once again outperform the industry as we did in 2017. And for Brazil, the market improved substantially more than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year."
1,"4 million used to repurchase shares of common stock in December, under which we generally attempted the repurchase of the maximum number of shares based on valuation, volume limits and blackout restrictions. This liquidity position allows us to execute our capital allocation plan and shareholder return initiatives, and evaluate opportunities to monetize tax assets and build on our existing platform. I'll now turn the call back over to Heath to walk through our go-forward strategy."
1,"4% of revenue. We see opportunities with success-based and network growth projects to leverage investment in broadband business and carrier customer channels across all of our markets. From a liquidity standpoint, we ended the quarter with approximately $15."
1,"4%, a loan-to-deposit ratio of 83% and a cost of deposits at 29 basis points. The combination of a well-capitalized balance sheet and low-cost funding will allow us to fund accretive growth in the coming years. And in summary, we remain well positioned to achieve our strategic and financial objectives and are positioned in the fastest-growing markets in Florida, which will lead to solid organic growth while inorganic growth from M&A opportunities remains available across our target markets."
1,"42) Open Banking and PSD2 which changes the environment requiring banks to provide an open API for customers so that more fintech providers can access platforms. But that really plays right to our solutions as well because that allows us to provide a platform for single consolidated picture of cash and it allows us also see opportunity with those banks to give them the technologies they need to compete in what's a continually evolving environment. So, we'd like where we sit from a competitive standpoint, but it's definitely a moving market."
1,"43) And because so many people now are hooked to our SFTI network and increasingly hooking to our SFTI network, in fact, it's one of the fastest growing parts of our company, they have a pipe already that is secure, that has a cyber-security provenance over it that allows us to pretty easily get behind firewalls and deliver new products and services. So it's going well."
1,"43) technology to extend it throughout the home. And so, all that wraps up into a very high level of energy in terms of continuing to distinguish the broadband product and so I think that's all ties so up into why we feel confident. And I guess one last point, we continue to see massive growth in the use of our network, so I think meeting the usage by the median customer, up 50% from a year ago."
1,"44) gross margins despite a very large competition around us. The technology allows us to have a very steep cost curve that allows us to drop the cost of our products much quicker than our competitors. And since we're the most profitable company today, most of our competitors do not really have the ability to drop prices."
1,"47) in Wireless. The planning process of course 2,500 is extremely dense and allows us to manage tremendous amounts of capacity. The plan works and we're able to actually improve the customer experience as we do the refarm and then the LTE network continues to be wide open even in Toronto."
1,"48) it could be consumer packaged goods or pharmaceuticals, financial services, there are significant opportunities where they don't want, for instance, Deutsche Bank wouldn't want just somebody sitting in a Deutsche Bank branch, a bank in Germany, they'd want them in a Deutsche Bank branch and they wouldn't want anything that would be less authentic. So, there can be lots of uses of stock inventory but to the extent that they wanted customers and/or employees in imagery or footage they would want that to be more authentic."
1,"48) to put that operational expense into business build out, that capability of product engineering is one capability that I would say the business has been lacking. That is the thing that we think will allow us to return to growth in 2019."
1,"5 billion revenue, 20% to 25% operating profit, we're generating over $100 million of cash a year at that point. So we have significant opportunity to get out in the market and make incremental acquisitions that would actually allow us to grow faster in the plan that we published."
1,5 million and as an option to fund additional $10 million of R&D work. This upsized BARDA deal allows us to turn NexoBrid into a self-funded opportunity as the contract covers all NexoBrid's R&D program costs. In our U.
1,"5 million and we're working on a environmental abatement program in Europe. It's another large program north of a million dollars which will allow us to run to the high speed coaters at the same time as well as a lot of other efficiencies in terms of environmental costs that we have right now. So that's one program we're working on this year, but other than that our   sort of our maintenance CapEx will remain in that $0."
1,"5 million customers, and that's what drives the vast majority of our operating expense. Where we see opportunities here and we're definitely forecasting a significant reduction in operating expense in 2018 is as the portfolio is amortizing, those costs come down. As the portfolio seasons and borrowers are in   more likely to be making payments and less likely to be moving back and forth between different statuses, costs come down as well."
1,"5 million milestone payment, which was triggered by successfully entering the clinic with PRS-060 which occurred in December of 2017. This partnership allows us to leverage Astra's established expertise in complex inhalation formulations and devices for respiratory diseases, as well as their global commercial capabilities as a leader in this space. This collaboration covers up to five programs, including PRS-060 with co-development and co-commercialization opportunities for both PRS-060 and two other programs within this alliance."
1,"5 million over 2018. Finally, we anticipate we will have sufficient funds without additional financing to support our operations into 2020, which will allow us to reach significant milestones for both OvaPrime and OvaTure. Thank you for your attention."
1,"5 million. We're proud to help contribute to Massachusetts energy goals and we also have significant opportunities to continue growing our electric operations by pursuing reliability and grid modernization initiatives in both Massachusetts and New Hampshire, both of which enjoy significant regulatory support. Now I'll turn the call over to Mark Collin, who will discuss our 2017 financial results, as well as our current regulatory proceedings."
1,"5 times EBITDA. Our new debt structure and capacity also provide great flexibility should larger core acquisitions become available that would add significant value through synergy capture or entering into higher growth markets, or if we see opportunities for businesses that are complementary to our core cash business that support our overall strategy and accelerate value growth. Our focus and strategy is to accelerate growth and profitability by servicing the total cash ecosystem."
1,"5 times net debt EBITDA, which is non-negotiable and crucial for our business. Our view is that 2018 will be again another challenging year, but with significant opportunities. So, we are pretty sure that we are all prepared for the year which is in front of us."
1,"5 times. This allows us to be opportunistic when the stock market may be disconnected from our view of intrinsic value of the company while still allowing us to self-fund our unit growth through cash flow generation and enhance shareholder returns through our ongoing share repurchase program. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our solid financial performance in 2017 that exceeded our expectations."
1,5 trillion. These will allow us to continue to work the inorganic growth opportunities in the future. The cash position of the year allowed us to prepay our debt by $2.
1,"5% compared to the prior year. Moving to income taxes, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December created a significant opportunity for the business and a boatload of additional work for our tax and accounting teams over the past few months, a special call out to them for the incredible personal leadership and commitment and working long hours through the various elements of the tax reform that will benefit us for a long time. I'll split the discussion on taxes into two key elements."
1,"5% of our portfolio was in second lien loans. Looking forward, we feel confident that through our multiple origination engines, including NorthMill and Gemino, as well as enhanced scale across the Solar platform, we will continue to grow SUNS portfolio. We are confident that the solid foundation of our portfolio's strong credit profile combined with our available capital and ability to originate across multiple business lines position SUNS to grow investment income."
1,"51) top-line and bottom-line benefits to LogMeIn shareholders. In short, we believe that this has the potential to be a transformative deal for our communications and collaboration business, a deal that allows us to accelerate the strategy we laid out during our recent Investor Day and deliver an integrated platform that unlocks the potential of the modern workforce by transforming the way people work. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Ed Herdiech, for details on the transaction and its expected financial impact."
1,"52) a very good opportunity, and from   and the other part is board exam sample papers flow in very well with our tuition market. The Science Parivaar allows us to, what we look at a similar offering for Maharashtra Board next year and then this segment, which comes to us for Maharashtra Board or for CBSE or Sample Papers, becomes a data, which we can leverage for further Test Prep services."
1,"54) and significant opportunity for us to grow our portfolio. I think Bombay being our home market and being obviously the market with the best pricing will probably remain the most important market first, particularly once you factor in the Vikhroli development."
1,"55 per carton in the prior-year period. We expect the new lemon packing facility will allow us to efficiently manage the planned growth in our fresh lemon volume from our own acreage as it becomes productive as well as additional third-party grower lemons, which we are actively recruiting. We currently have over 8,200 planted agricultural acres, of which approximately 1,600 acres are currently non-bearing lemons and are estimated to become full bearing over the next four years."
1,"55) substances for the textile product and so on. So in there, we also have product mix diversification that allows us to maintain or to improve the margin in some of the segment as well."
1,"57) is to try and merge and partner by joining assets with other entities to grow, and we're in that second line. We have an international activity we believe is working well or at least reasonably well, which is providing performance and revenue that we did not have in the past, and that will allow us to balance the dependence of the Spanish regulated sector, and, in that line, we would like to continue to grow in an independent way. And for that to do so, the best way, though this is not automatic and is not simple to do in six months, is by finding a partner, which will have similar objectives to us, so we can merge some of his and our assets so that we can have a better base for growth."
1,"58) that if you have a production kind of a use case that's very vital for overall our growth. And I think my view is we need to find more and more use cases like this, which will give us significant opportunity for growth both in hardware and in materials."
1,"59) Our plan to purchase four additional haul trucks will allow us to increase production capacity to over 250,000 ounces of gold by 2022, while maintaining our near-term production profile. This is a logical and disciplined approach to capital investment which gives us confidence to push the equipment replacement study into 2019 since it focuses on our loader fleet."
1,"7 billion at the retail level of the estimated $125 billion automotive hard parts aftermarket. Our diagnostic products, which are sold worldwide, also have significant opportunity in a separate $5 billion global market. We are fortunate to have a global footprint and an exceptional management team that enables the company to maintain a competitive cost structure for our existing product lines and to effectively pursue new product line expansion opportunities based on sound economics and quality."
1,"7 billion in total annual cost savings, a large portion of the reductions will come from cost of goods sold through supply chain optimization such as manufacturing, sourcing, procurement and vendor consolidation. We also identified significant opportunities from the elimination of duplicative corporate functions and R&D spend. Finally, the Fuji Xerox joint venture is commencing a cost reduction program immediately, which is expected to deliver approximately $450 million in annual cost savings by 2022."
1,"7% compared to the same quarter last year. This increase, mainly attributed to an increase in head count, is consistent with our decision to invest resources, in product development and innovation, cost reduction and advance manufacturing processes that will allow us to continue to bring new products to the market as well as reduce the cost of our current products and further improve their quality. Our financial strength and growing profitability fueled these investments."
1,"75% of our company is a technology-based processing business and 25% is investment management, where technology will continue to become a more important tool for success. Our technology will define our future, and we need to ensure we're investing to create the highest quality infrastructure and a platform which allows us to both drive significant efficiencies in the future, as well as be agile enough to allow us to move quickly as we expand our product offerings. We are well into this journey and seek to accelerate the effort."
1,8 billion at year-end. The Tax Act allows us to use this balance and future international cash flows in the U. S.
1,"8 million of net cash proceeds to the Company. This financing, along with our existing cash and short-term investments, provided us with more than $100 million of liquid assets, which will allow us to continue to advance our pipeline through the clinic for many quarters. Our common shares outstanding at December 31, 2017 were $74."
1,"8% is a benchmarkable performance and puts us near the top in comparison to our peer group. As we look ahead, we are focusing on accelerated core growth with a solid foundation and diversified portfolio that allows us to outperform the market and which creates growth opportunities and multiple revenue streams. As you can see on slide 15, with our diversified portfolio, we served more than 600 OE and aftermarket customers spread across all regions and different product applications."
1,"80, a reduction of 40% from 2016. This rebasing to a lower level is appropriate for SES and will allow us to strengthen our balance sheet while supporting growth opportunities and enabling the progressive dividend in the future. We are deeply aware that it has been a difficult period for our share price."
1,"9 million connected devices. It's that connectivity, which allows us to get recurring revenue, and as we put applications and additional services in Verifone Connect, that revenue growth will accelerate. We think about it as our recurring revenues in the company."
1,9 million expansion of our par-fried capacity at the prepared chicken plant and expect new business to move the plant to near full capacity later this year. The expansion will allow us to process 50% more par-fried pounds or 32% more of total pounds of prepared chicken and allow us to generate $60 million in additional sales annually. We look forward to improve performance at that plant this year.
1,"9 times. In terms of capital allocation, our primary focus remains investing in our core business, as we believe this will allow us to continue to grow AOI on a sustainable basis. We will continue to be disciplined and opportunistic in our use of capital for both repurchases and non-organic investments."
1,"9%, exceeding the high end of our initial guidance range and mostly driven by the same-property portfolio, accretive investments and opportunistic capital market activities. As always, we focus on driving growth to the bottom line, which allows us to have one of the best track records in the industry for dividend growth. To that end, later this month, we expect our Board of Directors to approve our 24th consecutive annual increase in the common dividend, positioning us nicely to become a dividend aristocrat a year from now."
1,"A large percentage of those IT budgets now   or an increasing percentage of those IT budgets being earmarked for digital initiatives. So, across the BFS landscape, we have seen significant opportunities around digital transformation. We've seen significant opportunities around payment transformation."
1,A major area of focus of our innovation last year was the continued expansion of skin care with the launch of our Beauty Shield and Active lines. Both are great examples of how our flexible innovation approach allows us to move quickly on trends. We were also able to improve our speed to market.
1,"Absolutely believe that there are lots of tremendous opportunities for us to deploy that capital against strategic M&A, and will do so where we find opportunities to accelerate towards our mission and vision. And we want to help deliver customer communications to drive engagement and growth where we see opportunities to accelerate what we're doing in our Email API business. That certainly would be top to the list."
1,"Absolutely. The number one, you're absolutely right, we see a very significant opportunity in Latin America for Used Cars because it's a part of the world where, historically, used cars, sold by franchise dealers, is actually underdeveloped. You still have a market, which is more in private to private, and we really see the opportunity and we see consumers being more and more interested to buy from a proved source like Inchcape would be, yeah?"
1,"According to data released by the State Post Bureau, ZTO once again received one of the highest scores for customer satisfaction among the major express companies in China during the quarter. We acquired China Oriental Express during the quarter, which will allow us to provide services beyond express delivery such as freight forwarding and other international logistic services, as well as increase our exposure outside China and further differentiate ourselves from our competitors. As of December 31, 2017, we have in store a total of 58 automatic sorting equipments at 43 sorting hubs across the country, an increase of 17 lines from the third quarter of 2017."
1,"Achieving success at that stage certainly gives every physician the opportunity to think about, if you're going to use an SGLT2 which one can you use and stay with through the course of the patient's journey knowing the fact that a number of them will become renally impaired. That allows us to address the entire market relative to having that indication. And so I think that is probably the most aggressive approach that we're taking here strategically."
1,"Across the group, we now have pro forma annual gross sales of over Â£160 million transacted online, making us the largest seller of sofas online in the UK. We have completed our acquisition of Sofology, which adds a brand that is successfully appealing to a different group of customers, but allows us to leverage DFS' operating platform to improve profitability. Our partnership brands have continued to grow well helped by new ranges introduced and our new partnership with Joules is showing very promising early results."
1,"Across the portfolio, we will continue to test new benches conducting spacing and stacking trials. Our short cycle times and real-time data analytics allows us to quickly incorporate learnings into subsequent cube developments. We strive to make each cube better than the last."
1,"Adding WMI's electrical wire cabling, integrated electronics and wire harnesses capabilities gives us greater control over content for integration work. For our pod business, this means we can offer customers like United Technologies with their TacSAR pod, or Raytheon with their Next Generation Jammer Pod, a more integrated solution that elevates our standing as a key partner in their production processes, allows us to bid on larger work packages and expands content share on existing programs. Also, WMI has a long-standing relationship with Raytheon on the SEASPARROW Guided Missile Launching System, where it provides turnkey electronics integration solutions."
1,"Additionally, our free cash flow generation continues to strengthen our balance sheet and underlines our focus on financial discipline. This access to internal and external capital will allow us to pursue assets that align with our long-term growth initiatives while enabling us to continue to make the necessary investments internally to develop an innovative product portfolio. Now, let me provide you with an update on our financial guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2018 that Jim alluded to earlier."
1,"Additionally, our in-house retail and logistics networks will be a key catalyst to streamlining production and distribution. The cross-selling opportunity will allow us to reach new customers while strengthening relationships with existing customers. We also expect to achieve significant cost synergies through procurement activities and sharing of best practices."
1,"Additionally, our media technology and services are powering the performance media capabilities of retailers, using data to target ads served on retailer properties across the web and on social. We believe this key trend in the grocery space, which began with e-commerce retailers, has much more significant opportunity to attract media dollars from CPG brands by using in-store and online data to target and measure ads at a scale never seen before in the industry. As we look to the remainder of this year, we will continue to build on our accomplishments of 2017 and deliver on our strategy to be the digital commerce marketing platform for brands and retailers."
1,"Additionally, we have increased our access to total residential permits from 55% at the end of 2013 to nearly 70% at the end of 2017. This enhanced position allows us to provide more installation services while deepening the company's relationships with builders nationwide. These two core tenets of IBP's growth strategy, product line and geographic expansion along with customer acquisition are the drivers of our long-term effort to sell more installed products to our increasing customer base in an expanding geography."
1,"Additionally, we introduced SunTrust Deals, which offers personalized rewards and discounts based on clients' preferences and spending habits. We've also made good progress in developing an API and cloud-based framework for infrastructure and development, which allows us to more easily integrate with app, services, and digital experiences across the ecosystem. And finally, we've significantly enhanced our core infrastructure by upgrading our loan origination platforms within wholesale and mortgage, transferring certain activities to the cloud, and began upgrading our core teller platform, which when combined with our introduction of Zelle, significantly enhances our broader payment capabilities."
1,"Additionally, you see the multinationals adding capacity with foundry expansions and 3D-NAND expansions. So I think that we see opportunity. Maybe -?"
1,"Adjusted EBITDA totaled negative $300,000 compared to negative $700,000 in the year ago quarter. As we have noted today and in prior quarterly results, we have grown our Platform business at a strong clip and believe significant opportunities remain. Given our momentum and the large opportunities ahead of us, we have decided to be more opportunistic in future growth opportunities if we believe it can further accelerate customer adoption, even at the expense of being adjusted EBITDA breakeven in fiscal 2019."
1,"ADT is the largest customer of Connect and we are pleased to have been able to expand our partnership with ADT as a result of this acquisition. As two of the largest players in the Internet of Things and smart home ,market we are working together effectively on a number of opportunities that will allow us to create more value for the end customer, while growing our businesses. To summarize our year, we advanced our long-term vision for the business along multiple strategic fronts."
1,"Advanced analytics play an increasing role in modeling our solutions and optimizing the outcomes we deliver. Digital automation such as next-generation interactive voice recognition and process automation allows us to continue to drive efficiencies and improve the quality of our operations. These efforts enhance our competitive position and improve our overall service delivery across our operations, particularly when delivered through our shared services centers, which we've been building over the last two years."
1,"After which, I will open up the call for Q&A. I joined PfÃªnex last August because I saw a company with a unique and validated protein expression platform, a broad differentiated portfolio and a very talented team, as well as a company that I believe has significant opportunities for future growth. I realized the company was in need of change to unlock its true potential."
1,"Again, Bill said it; we have done an extensive assessment of this market before making that move, as you can imagine. We've done a lot of market research ourselves, with KOL and hemophilia centers, and so we've done a thorough work which allows us to offer what we offer for that acquisition. So yes, we could   the short answer to your question is, yes, we believe Eloctate and Alprolix are going to continue to grow at a very significant level."
1,"Again, I think you've heard from Matt and some of the folks when you walk up to certain cars that used to be high strength steel, today's high strength steel, it's aluminum, it's nylon, it's carbon fiber, it's now magnesium. Many of these multi-metal, multi-material environment creates significant challenges for the OEM, create significant opportunities for us particularly in the area of corrosion and the area of substrate uniformity trying to cure multiple substrates at the same temperature, continues to drive, I think, technology into our paint and how we actually deliver the appearance in the corrosion performance that's expected by our customers. Advanced Manufacturing, again this fits into the value proposition, these are $0."
1,"Again, it's because of the investments we're making really are more in the marketing area given that we're coming off of a really low, if you will, year in marketing investments and then in R&D, we're continuing to make investments in R&D. If you look at in 2017, we did the acquisition of Connect and ObjectVideo and those really helped to set us up in terms of significant opportunities with regard to video analytics with Connect working with ADT. And so it's interesting to see the way the tax works out, EBITDA is obviously before tax."
1,"Again, no company in the world has probably done more to fight cervical cancer, breast cancer than Hologic has, and that's something we're really proud of. Significant opportunity to grow outside the United States had begun to show that in recent quarters. But I think there is a long runway ahead of us, especially because our R&D pipeline is getting better and better by the day."
1,"Again, this slide represents a medium-term market prognosis, but I do hope it is useful in explaining the underpinning strategic rationale for the broadening strategy we are on. We now have a business of significantly increased scale to capitalize on those macro themes, with the geographic spread, capability and operating model to take advantage of the significant opportunities in global energy and industrial markets, with some 55,000 people across over 60 countries. Wood is better placed to serve customers than ever before with a more comprehensive range of capabilities and the potential to deliver efficient integrated solutions and fewer customer interfaces."
1,"Again, we see the FlexGrid product as the perfect complement to our ground lease business. It allows us to deploy infrastructure at scale. It's designed to address critical network efficiency goals through network densification and co-location, and we have the ability to provide customized solutions for major commercial and consumer customers."
1,"Again, you'll hear Judy talk about that at length. It's important though because using digital tools will give us the ability to have customer contact and customer stickiness that will allow us to continue to grow the portfolio and serve the customers even better. Customer experience, this is one of my favorites."
1,Air Canada Rouge competes in Sun markets during the winter and in the secondary European and Asian leisure markets during the summer. It enhances margins in leisure markets and allows us to pursue opportunities in price-sensitive international leisure market with a competitive cost structure. We recently concluded amendments in our long-term labor agreement with our pilots.
1,"All of our store locations are leased, and as we scale the business and grow our footprint, we are seeing greater opportunities and advantages with our landlord partners. We have a flexible real estate model that allows us to successfully operate across diverse markets, as well as locations within shopping centers. Our store size, flexible store layout and operating requirements work well in all types of markets throughout the country."
1,"All of this reflects a very strong free cash flow from the operations. I would expect that to continue in this current metal price environment and just given that strong treasury profile, I think that really allows us to advocate that   the business plan, the business model moving forward is an internally funded one, which is obviously advantageous. With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to the operator please just for any questions that there may be on the line."
1,"All of what I've just described gives me confidence in our future and in our ability to continue to deliver on our strategy. The significant opportunities ahead of us require us to ensure the right level of investment behind R&D and certain commercial capabilities, and we are doing just that. And turning to slide 18, please, a year ago, I spoke about the work we were doing to evolve our operating model."
1,"All these are examples of how we manage the risk of new work. So, to conclude, we delivered a good first half result, supported by our leading positions in our chosen markets, which allows us to outperform the underlying market. We believe these are growth markets, underpinned by long-term fundamentals that match the UK's priorities and are supported by government policies, whether it's investing in upgrading the UK's infrastructure, the regeneration of our regional cities or the provision of more affordable housing, schools and hospitals to support the UK's population growth."
1,"Allison, maybe if I can just add to Mark's response. A lot of the way that we have set up the business is that we have pretty substantial relationships through the bidding process and lane opportunities and where a number of Truckload carriers will really kind of shift their emphasis into the spot are probably comes   our company probably goes at this more in terms of exercising choice so as more opportunities are there, Quest allows us to look at where those opportunities are, not just what we're taking today, but what we project will be out in markets continuing to manage how the network flows. But do it more within the contract relations that we've got."
1,"Along the lines of when these lots will be delivered, I think it's something that we focused on quite heavily and feel puts The New Home Company in a very strong position is that while we own or control slightly over 6,000 lots, 65% of those slots are on options. That allows us to adapt, I think, and to any changing market conditions, and in a perfect world, it lets us take down lots just in time. So, and in some situations, we'll even be able to be building homes on those lots before we take down the land."
1,"Along with focusing on improving the company's fundamentals, I assure you that we are focused diligently on better communicating in an effort to earn a valuation multiple, more correlative to our peers in the industry. In closing, I want to personally thank you   say thank you to all of our financial partners, both joint venture and franchise, that will allow us to double our Little Big Burger locations this year and continue our BGR on a successful path. I also want to thank our approximate 1,000 employees across our entire brand portfolio for their continuing support and commitment to our collective success."
1,"Also on December 1st again as previously announced we did complete the management and brand changed in Denver moving from a Marriott to a Hilton. This move resulted in a more efficient and flexible management agreement under Hilton, which primarily allows us to move away from the onerous IMF situation that we had under the legacy Marriott management contract. We're off to a good start with our new managing partner Hilton and we're optimistic about our performance in Denver for 2018."
1,"Also we have been able to acquire and continuously acquire new customer base while lowering the expenses of advertising and marketing, thanks to all, one the merger to Proximus but also toward better management our advertising and marketing cost by focusing more on the right messages and the right channels. So after two years of important savings we feel confident that we will be able to continue to drive gross cost savings through further companywide transformation and we are planning and we will grow cost savings in the range of $75 million to $80 million for the coming three years. So further also a few highlights on some elements where the company is really putting a lot of energy on which is the further transformation of the company in three important domain, the digital transformation, the IT transformation and to further the network transformation."
1,"Altria's current 10. 2% interest in AB InBev allows us to participate in the global beer profit pool and supplements our strong internal cash flows with dividends, which totaled over $800 million in 2017. We've also reduced cost in our core business and strengthened our balance sheet, all to provide the financial firepower and flexibility needed for the next chapter of our success."
1,"And   large or small, I totally agree. So that   we can't under exercise the importance of that, because that liquidity is what really allows us to innovate in product. We can deliver incredible new features to our users by virtue of having the liquidity to actually fulfill."
1,"And a company like AngioDynamics has the market clout to get it to market in the right way. So, we look for more opportunities to find partnerships such as those, which I think will allow us to bring these numbers into play during this three-year period."
1,"And a final point here almost now to the whole thing is the power of the ASX brand. This allows us to be a trusted central counterparty and has in the equity and futures market, but also not only to clearing and settlement, but also a technology for data and for analytics services. So to summarize, ASX is investing in technology and we'll continue to invest in technology to improve our products and services to customers."
1,and about 8% for Applebee's. Our international division represents a significant opportunity for us. The next slide provides a visual snapshot of our significant domestic scale with strong presence on the southern region and on both coasts.
1,"And all of our expansion in the upcoming year is going to really be tied to these greenfield markets and it's going to be a tremendous opportunity. And between the business and the geographical expansion of our distribution, it will allow us to actually be more efficient in the two-thirds and then the old way that we've always done business in two-thirds of the country. So it's going to create even a double whammy on margin expansion."
1,"And also because the vast majority of these patients are in the adolescent area have metabolic syndromes as one of the fundamental underlying parts of their condition leading to NASH, there should be a strong crossover between the core data and the sub-study data that we're doing to give us some proof of the mechanisms that we expect to impact this space that was translating over to the adults. And so, we think that the combination of the two studies we're doing allows us to move forward not only in the pediatrics but adults, as well as special populations like FPL."
1,"And also we've looked at the organizational structure at KCM and we've empowered the lowest levels of the operating unit to make decisions, take responsibility and have accountability. Once Phase I is complete, we're also very much focused on moving into Phase II which will allow us to realize the full potential of the Konkola mine and the Nchanga operations. And discussions are already underway with various subject matter experts on mine design, de-watering, development rates, debottlenecking and the potential is clear."
1,"And also, procuring   construction and procuring CapEx a lot more efficiently than we do today. So, we think that's a very significant opportunity. And the fifth one is a little less modelable from your point of view, but we're spending a lot of time and effort on inclusion and diversity in the company, which we think is going to be   pay dividends."
1,"And as a complement to our digital strategies, our omni-channel capabilities continue to expand. Our endless aisle functionality allows us to fulfill in-store demand with our e-commerce inventory. We have the ability to ship from store in 186 locations, and we'll further expand this capability in 2018."
1,"And as Daniel mentioned, we anticipate our total addressable market to grow to over 3 billion in the future. And as you can see, there is still significant opportunity remaining, both where Spotify is already available and in new markets. So, that's freemium, it's sticky, it's got brand love, and it's sitting on top of millions of free users that are moving closer to premium every day."
1,"And as Dave mentioned, we're working on a variety of what we see as opportunities to accelerate investments in the business, especially as we think about the opportunities that exist with Aetna. And as we finalize those plans, we'll have more to talk about in terms of where we see opportunities to do exactly that."
1,"And as far as investments in our employees, service and capabilities, especially at retail, will continue to grow in importance. And specifically, these investments will allow us to enhance the role that pharmacy technicians play, which we believe is key to enhancing the role that pharmacy can play in overall patient care. As far as the level of investments, in terms of what Dave was talking about, I would say that a lion's share of that is investments into and with our employees versus in the other areas."
1,"And as I mentioned, we have a large customer base from which we do upsells, and it's very cost effective for us to upsell additional solutions to our existing customer base. So we see opportunity to expand margins in the future. We decided to   we know that there's a lot we want to do to continue to grow the company, so we decided to just guide for flat margins, and if we do better than that's upside for our shareholders."
1,"And as I previously mentioned, there is potential for further upside to leverage our complementary capabilities of the combined platform for additional growth. This acquisition will allow us to generate value across both sides of the combined A. Schulman and LyondellBasell businesses."
1,"And as it happens, it does two things, which is what I said about at the beginning, which is making our customer experience with us digital and similarly within or inside our enterprise. So the whole benefit of SD-WAN is that it will ultimately automate the way in which telecom services are ordered, provisioned, serviced to make them more dynamic, which we think will drive more need for bandwidth, create more elasticity in our people buying bandwidth, but more importantly for us as an industry, it will allow us to take a huge amount of cost out internally, which we think is a win-win situation for both our customers and for us. So we are very excited about it and we intend to aggressively pursue that path."
1,"And as that happens, that is creating, first of all, significant ease with asset managers who we think will go through a lot of the same challenges in the next 10 years that our capital markets clients went through in the past 10 years. So, that's creating much more openness to outsourcing non-differentiating activities which is a significant opportunity for us. And then it's also providing those knock-on things in Wealth Management as I've talked about."
1,"And as we collect the data and integrate that back in with EHR systems, we're able to drive parameters that optimize the operation of both the pharmacy and the outcomes for the patient. We've connected all of our solution sets to the cloud data platform, which allows us to collect just enormous amounts of data as we touch and see pharmacy movements throughout all the clinics and the provider networks. One of our latest and most exciting pieces of automation, we just introduced a month ago, is the XR2."
1,"And as we invest in infrastructure at Kittila, we should see the Kittila production base move to between 250,000 ounces to 275,000 ounces on a big reserve base. We should also highlight the fact that the Nunavut platform, as it allows us to grow output, will improve our operating margin at the sites at the same time as our CapEx declines. So we're peaking in CapEx this year, a little under $1."
1,"And as we think about the capabilities, broadly speaking, we think about a health service company and a pharmacy services company with a broad array of services for consumers, a dedication toward differentiation for consumers' lives and an orientation on partnering. So, when you put the package together with those billion touch points and growing, we have a further significant opportunity to change people's lives for the better, therefore, improve affordability, and as a result, provide a tremendous return to our shareholders."
1,"And as we've highlighted in detail at the Investor Outlook Meeting, we're investing to accelerate growth in China and more broadly in developing Asia. We see opportunities across the portfolio of businesses. And something else that we've shared with investors in the past is our focus on improving profitability in Western Europe, we are   have laid out a plan to move from 16% operating income to 20% by 2020."
1,"And as you rightly pointed out, while our share of ULIP has gone from 50% to 59% and the profitability of ULIP products is definitely lower than some of the other product categories, we have been able to compensate for lower margin on some of these additional growth we have got by continuing to grow ours, for example the protection business on both the individual and the group side. So this balance allows us to continue to deliver these margins on a consistent basis. We have said that our ULIP, share of ULIP in the individual business is continuing to sink from 50% to 60%, it is close to 60% right now."
1,"And at the end of the year, we made a tax efficient contribution to the pensions of $5 billion as a result of the new tax legislation. The funding allows us to optimize the tax benefit, lower ongoing expense and further unlock cash flow moving forward. The company made capital expenditures in 2017 of $5."
1,"And at the same time, we manage to significantly improve our leverage to below two times. And as a result, this allows us to propose a dividend of CHF 4 per share. This is a 20% year-over-year increase and in line with our guidance."
1,"And basically, just two takeaways, gout and Still's are very substantial indications. We basically figure that there's a very significant opportunity for gout we have on phase 2, the trial is ongoing. In Still's, we are already in phase 3."
1,"And basically, what we're doing is leveraging the strength of our platform in Medicaid with the local market expertise and their relationships and the provider network. So that's been a really strong opportunity for us, it allows us to leverage our investments and quite frankly our return on capital for an investment that we think gives us greater presence and depth in the marketplace. We also have some other capabilities, and I've been really impressed by some of the other assets that we have inside of Anthem, for example, our AIM subsidiary that I shared with you, is another great opportunity that I see, an ability to package that to continue to scale it and invest in capabilities, and we already do a lot of that work with other Blue's across the system."
1,"And beyond the scale that we have to service our customers, think about the scale that we have from a product sourcing perspective, from a product manufacturing perspective, there's a lot of medical supplies that have been in the market for a long time and that are sold by a lot of our competitors, including Amazon, which has been selling medical supplies on their platforms for a long time. But if you talk to our customers and we hear this all at the time, we bring to the table a very competitive cost structure and it allows us to have tremendous penetration with our acute customers and outside the acute system also with all our classes of trade. So, that scale makes us comfortable that we either should be able to withstand the competition from other large companies like Amazon or others like that."
1,"And definitely, we see opportunities of our panel with human health companies, biotech companies or pharma companies without animal health division. It's something now that we have this access."
1,"And definitely, we'll continue to focus on our core business. The core business will continue generating the majority of our revenues and profits, but we see opportunities to accelerate our growth by investing in some of these complementary spaces. Definitely, genetics, diagnostics, data analytics are part of this effort."
1,"And every turn for us is $10 to our share price. So, we think there's a significant opportunity as this industry convinces the market that we're more sustainable than we have been in the past, and that may take a year or two years. Again, we've had six years of improving earnings, and a lot of the airlines have."
1,"And finally, acquisitions. The TIC market continues to be a very fragmented market and we see opportunities to acquire companies which help us to expand our portfolio of services within our business lines or to enter new geographies or improve or acquire customer relationships. We have not been very active in the last few years."
1,"And finally, our leverage ratio of approximately 22% is below our target of 25%. This provides us financial flexibility in managing our overall capital position and allows us to be opportunistic in accessing the capital markets. With that, we'd like to open up the call for questions."
1,"And finally, we are   our software, we are utilizing RDMA technology to cut down on the network fab latency. So really an example of how our platform allows us to work the whole body to really juice up application performance."
1,"And first, and the most obvious one, is we're expanding our land capacity. Secondly, we are developing new ways to handle the cars, which allows us to store more cars on the same facility. And then third, we're exploring any ways that we can to reduce the cycle time to get the cars sold faster."
1,"And for example, while we're launching new products like the Naturals I just mentioned, we're also focused on reducing the complexity of our business by eliminating less productive SKUs. This allows us to be more efficient and effective in bringing these products to the marketplace. Now, if we look at our SKUs on a global basis, we see them down about 7% on a global basis."
1,"And for the full year, it declined by 103 basis points. Further efficiency improvement remains a significant opportunity for the company, and we'll move down meaningfully as efficiencies are captured post core systems conversion with Xenith. Xenith aside, numerous opportunities for efficiency improvement remain at Union and were identified through our peer benchmarking work done last year and are being executed on a path independent from the integration work."
1,"And for us as a Unisteel division, since we positioned that in the end market Electronics the initiatives of smart home is an important one for us in the future as well. Especially also since we see that quite a lot of software companies like Google, as I mentioned, they clearly seek now also access to the hardware and there we see opportunities that we can position ourselves as a viable supplier when it comes down to specify and design engineered solutions within those applications."
1,"And for us, this is the right match for the reasons that Anders also outlined in the beginning. We see our two businesses, our two organizations as very complementary, and this will allow us to build a true Nordic player where again the scale point is very important. TV 2 in Denmark has a lot of great content, but is again a Danish business."
1,"And fourth, making our culture and reputation a competitive advantage. Nothing is more important than having a culture that allows us to attract the best people. We are investing significantly in sales enablement, technical training, and leadership development programs, talent acquisition and other initiatives to make MongoDB a place where employees can have the opportunity to grow and succeed in their careers."
1,"and France. Overall, the combination of Rayonier Advanced Materials and Tembec creates a company with greater scale, a better-balanced portfolio, and significant opportunities for growth. I would now like to briefly review each of our business segments before turning the call over to Frank."
1,"And further at a 92% cash conversion ratio in 2017, the combined business becomes even more cash-efficient driving cash flow accretion and dividend coverage and this will be discuss later on the call. The transaction allows us to dramatically increase our scale, while keeping our full focus on the Nordic markets, so where we will be the leading convergent player. Pernille?"
1,"And given our projections and the way we're looking at things over the next couple of years, we think we can continue that growth trajectory. And what I'll say is that, having OMP around to fund the midstream side of it allows us to put capital back to what we think very strong capital efficiency metrics. You look at most of our activity is going to be in that Wild Basin, Alger areas over the year, and those wells are, call it, one-year cash paybacks because they're pretty strong, kind of recycling cash at a very fast rate."
1,"And given the volatility that we've seen in recycling commodity prices over the last 7 to 10 years, we continue to take actions to de-risk this business and shift to a more processing fee-based model and a more equitable sharing of the commodity risk with our customer. And this allows us to ensure that we're making an appropriate return on our investment both in good pricing and lower pricing commodity markets. So, we consume approximately 160 million gallons of fuel on an annual basis, approximately 83% of these gallons are diesel and the remainder are compressed natural gas."
1,"And going to page 53, this healthy performance does not exclude but even supports a case for additional future growth. You've seen that we pretend to unlock a very significant number of additional rents coming from capturing reversion, coming from a very substantial pipeline and coming from the acquisition of Axiare that will allow us to remain in the right level of growth. Just to end with this presentation, just to highlight in terms of dividend guidance that we showed at the beginning, but we now emphasize now that at this moment, we are guiding you through a new number of dividend that we will propose to the AGM that will be â‚¬0."
1,"And having learned the lesson from Europe, we will deploy optimized channel strategies to not be active ourselves in every single geographical market in our emerging markets business. So to wrap it up, MSA International segment covers large and attractive markets, the developed Western European markets which are large and have a significant opportunity for expanding market share. And the emerging markets, where there's a lot of tailwind which would drive   help support us in driving revenue growth."
1,"And I don't see that changing. So, the only change that we're going to make is really driving down our cost when it comes to our phosphate business, which I think is really important as well as it will allow us to capture the ammonium sulfate growing market. So ammonium sulfate is a market that is about 3."
1,"And I guess what we see is a portfolio of different products that fits a dense MDU application, maybe it's better off to have a fiber link directly to the MDU and all the functionality is kind of concentrated in the remote device. So, we see opportunities for that permutation of the product as well. We have a variety of requirements from customers on, what are the capabilities in the node, do you want two forward pass or four forward pass or one."
1,"And I know that you can probably see our enthusiasm for the business. We do believe we have significant opportunities to grow our share, our sales and our profitability. And we are uniquely positioned with the physical assets, the digital assets that we have and using the ONETractor strategy anytime, anywhere, and in any way for our customers."
1,"And I think as we improve the integrity and reliability of the schedule as we've seen in winter 2017 and as you saw us announce last week in summer 2018, the ability to improve our schedule to improve the regularity of services between points like Calgary-Vancouver, Calgary-Edmonton, Edmonton-Vancouver, we're pricing off the back of that. It's improving our reach to premium travelers for whom schedule reliability is absolute prerequisite and key criteria, but it's also giving us the opportunity to choose the higher yielding of connecting passengers versus point-to-point passengers and the number of connections over our key hubs of Toronto, Vancouver, and Calgary is growing double-digit every month and that gives us a significant opportunity to increase yield."
1,"And I think if I just add to that is also while we're talking about operating expenses here, we still have opportunity as we talked about with our hardware transition and supply chain transition as an example to go after costs in that supply chain. As we change the supply chain and change our approach, we see opportunities. So we still will be looking at, as I said before, going after our COGS to help in the effort and to bring the margins up to where they should be."
1,"And I think obviously, we're skewed to one customer in that business from a size perspective and we've seen a lot of increase in activity from them, which is again very favorable. But today, we're experiencing multiple opportunities across multiple customers there today, which   in a much bigger way than we ever had before, which is also exciting because it allows us to diversify that business a little bit. The good thing is there's no doubt that it's coming."
1,"And I think our objective in this plan going forward for 2022 is to protect that base and enhance it. I think the marketplace will allow us to do it because I think the customer base   at least our relevant customer base is actually much wider than we have historically thought, and it certainly is growing at a pretty rapid clip. So it's not a volume issue for us."
1,"And I think our society has noticed that difference for a really long time, and that's why there's different regulations and rules around communicating with your friends and broadcasting media. And so, for us, as we evolve the product, I think this allows us to really reinforce the great things about our communications products, bring friends closer to together and, at the same time, provide more distribution to really high-quality content. So, I think we're trying to stay way ahead of the curve on this stuff and a thing we care a lot about."
1,"And I think that for a company like Merck, we'll continue to be focused on innovation, not consolidation as a strategy. And so, when we look at opportunities, while we don't rule anything out, we look across the whole spectrum of opportunities, our focus is really, as I said before, on doing the kind of deals that will allow us to bring great drugs to the market."
1,"And I think that overall approach has allowed us then to move forward and do clinical collaborations with both BMS and Roche/Genentech. In a way, that allows us to gain some early insight data and data into either combinations around the doublets of either cabo-nivo or cabo-atezo with Roche, but also the triplet cabo-nivo-ipi, in terms of how we can move forward across various tumor types. So the early data looks encouraging for both doublets and the triplets."
1,"And I think that we want to maintain that level of value for us or otherwise, it wouldn't be worth to us pursuing those opportunities, we would be better served doing more internal programs as opposed to external programs. And so, what I can say is that there's still interest in the business alliance with other potential partners on both sides of the table and even with that value proposition that we demand in our deals, because if we continue to get these approvals in a very complex area, in a very difficult area trying to get these things through the FDA, I think, that doing more business alliance minimizes our risk in those programs and allows us to take little bit more risk on our internal pipeline. And so, I think, it's a real nice balance that we have and I can't particularly comment on the areas of business that we may get in the future with partners."
1,"And I think that work has been demonstrated and has benefited both the patient, the payer, and our business. As it relates to biosimilars, we think biosimilars will provide a significant opportunity for the company starting really in oncology, because that's the first place where we can provide evidence of the effectiveness or efficacy of a biosimilar that's competing against someone who has a foundation already in the practice. And the first question people ask when there is a biosimilar is, will it do exactly what I expect it to do and will it do what the performance drug, the first drug out, is doing for our patients."
1,"And I think the relevance of plant-based protein is only going to get bigger. Our Evol business has also been very strong and this idea of more premium priced clean ingredient food now with the addition of some of the health benefits we're bringing with our modern nutrition bowls, which unlike a lot of bowls that are out there that are just general health, we see a significant opportunity to better meet specific consumer needs with bowls that have unique combinations of ingredients that meet your goal. Whether it be performance or sustained energy or just general balanced health."
1,"And I think we could easily over the next three years see a doubling of these things. And again, the other piece is we've done a great job of driving a technological approach to what we do that's lightweight and it allows us to be far more nimble as we customize these programs, particularly for health plans who really want to put their brands on them and go and compete. And I'm in receipt of a   I'm actually sitting here and I was sharing with my team a brochure from HealthNow in upstate New York where they actually published a brochure on the value of integration and they talk all about our programs in there."
1,"And I think we'll continue to add to that in 2018, that remains a priority. But if we see opportunities as we've mentioned in the past with respect to bring in investment capabilities or small acquisitions or anything that can ignite our growth and give us an opportunity to play a little bit of offense, that's something we're open to. It's just difficult to anticipate the timing on those things but we're definitely working and we'll just see what happens."
1,"And I think we've done a lot with New Zealand and I think that sort of a lot of those companies that we could have got are actually on the ASX. There's a significant opportunity in Israel. I think there's an opportunity in the United States and there's sort of pockets at Southeast Asia and other countries around the world that where   where we definitely   I don't know with the Chinese wearing shoe leather out or flying on planes around the world but there's a bit   certainly, there's a bit of marketing being done around to hunt down those opportunities."
1,"And I think we've got the tools and processes to effectuate that rather seamlessly. If I think of the digital supply chain that we have, I think of our in-control proprietary supply chain system that allows us to monitor risks and opportunities, it allows us to do real-time supply chain optimization and modeling. And then I feather in there some of the capabilities we have, whether it's our advancements in automation or advancements in robotics, our abilities in 3D print that oftentimes allow for manufacturing to be done at points closest to end consumption, I think we're well-positioned to benefit from these trends, but I'm not going to opine as to what's to happen in the future."
1,"And I think with the things that we're doing, that we've rolled out in Las Vegas that we're working with, not only JVCKENWOOD but other automakers with Xperi and with the connected car group of the American radio industry. We have a   we think we have a significant opportunity."
1,"And I think you asked about whether there is sort of an equal weighting across. All four we think represent significant opportunities. I don't think it's feasible to sort of measure the precise contribution, but what you saw was   we've seen significant   we've been sort of significantly further down the journey from a pricing standpoint and the other three areas are sort of more of a future opportunity."
1,"And I think you're going to see more of these kind of partnerships as we as we go forward and allow us to invest our dollars in the things that there's good news as we have a lot of opportunities. The challenge, and as Mike will say, every single one of them sounds like a really good project to do, we have to prioritize those dollars, and so we're going to focus our energies on what's going to get the highest and best yields for our clients and our shareholders at the end of the day, and doing these kind of partnerships really allows us to do that."
1,"And I would characterize that as certainly not a peak margin from our perspective. There's many things within our current or our past 2017 year that we would characterize as less than optimal that we think can be improved upon and we think that as we move forward into 2018 and into 2019 and 2020, we have significant opportunity to expand our margins. And I guess I'd say this way, one, I would characterize there being what we think is significant opportunity within the communications space; two, expand margins along with the growth that I'm portraying in terms of 5G, FirstNet, small cells, Verizon One Fiber, et cetera."
1,"And I would just add, Ritu, that the demonstrable evidence that TTR knockdown is associated with benefit that comes out of APOLLO provides a substantial de-risking of the ALN-TTRsc02 opportunity in our eyes relevant to all of those opportunities. So, it really for us, it really unlocks a significant amount of value and one that allows us to really grow and develop this area as the market leaders."
1,"And I would say working your way back from that, we've done a lot of analysis and a lot of work to understand where are those points of integration and how do they credibly improve patient physician experience. So, if you think about it from order management, scheduling, referral managements and then you link into that process, which is generally occurring in the ambulatory setting into the financial clearance and the back and forth that is occurring between the ambulatory and the acute setting inside of that set of process flows, we think there's a significant opportunity to reduce administrative complexity, introduce technologies. And we are seeing that with some of the pilots we're running already in some target markets both on physician self-service and physician satisfaction improvement, as well as patient satisfaction improvement."
1,"And if you look historically what happened is, the reason we're so comfortable with our new aspirational goal is that our organic growth grew significantly faster than our plan as a result of the markets we serve and share gain. So, this increase in organic growth, coupled with the commitment to acquire between $150 million to $200 million of acquired revenue is what allows us to comfortably set the goal to greater than $1 billion."
1,"And I'm excited to share with you the considerable progress we made in 2017, focusing the businesses on our high-growth product lines and implementing the performance improvement plan aimed toward focusing us on sustained growth in 2018 and beyond. I'm also here to tell you about the future growth opportunities for this business and why I think Hobsons is well-positioned to take advantage of many industry trends that will allow us to continue to increase our reach and our relevance in the education technology sector. Hobsons is a student success business."
1,"And important to this study is that men represent about 10% of the use of anabolic agents in the current osteoporosis market. I'll also comment that we are also planning to initiate a short-term bone histomorphometry study that will allow us to look at the early micro-architectural changes of TYMLOS in the skeleton, primarily in non-vertebral sites, and the study will be initiating in the first half of 2018. Another important part of TYMLOS lifecycle management is developments of the transdermal patch for TYMLOS, and this is really a key component of our ability to expand the global footprint for TYMLOS, as well as to extend the franchise with extended exclusivity."
1,"And in addition, we prioritized one investment with others for solving bottlenecks or increasing productivity as we have been doing. But what more or less makes sense to assume is that this is the figure which we feel comfortable in terms of the rhythm of our CapEx, and also, in terms of the cash flow we generate that allows us to cover it very, very easily."
1,"And in any other   if the news were to be correct, any other place that she would need to shop for young children's apparel, whether she goes into again mass business, department stores, our stores or she happens to click online to our sites or Amazon or what have you, we're there with our brands. So we feel confident that the brand health is very strong. She loves our products."
1,"And in certain markets, internationally it hasn't resonated at all. And so we see a pretty significant opportunity to update our entry-level form factor and go with product features that have proven to be very successful with consumers. So we're excited about that."
1,"And in credit, we just launched our first interval fund which can be offered continuously to a broad universe of investors. The interval fund structure allows us to translate some of the key benefits of less liquid often privately negotiated alternative credit into vehicles that are more accessible for individuals. At Blackstone, our entrepreneurial culture means we're always inventing new things in the interests of our limited partners."
1,"And in fact, there is obviously a huge amount of views on YouTube and Spotify that is people wanting to get on demand access to music without having to necessarily buy a subscription. And so Premium Access now allows us to fill that void as well with some incremental benefits in terms of creating a lot more video inventory for us which helps us drive modernization through RPMs. It's a much more favorable form of ad load because it's effectively an opt-in, value exchange type ad, which is much less intrusive from a consumer perspective."
1,"And in manufacturing, the refining portfolio is geographically balanced, good access to advantaged feedstock, such as heavy Canadian crudes in North America. While in petrochemicals, our latest technology allows us to deliver industry leading cost and environmental performance. I've already mentioned our move back into solar."
1,"And in that 2020 model, we also have very little included in these new markets. So, we'll still be in the early innings of significant opportunities for us to expand our served market in display. So, again, I think next two or three years, very high visibility."
1,And it also allows us to grow our multi-family lending business on non-GSE capital sources.
1,"And it also opens up a growth opportunity that heretofore wasn't really that achievable for us with what I'll call, the long tail, a lot of the smaller, more innovative companies that are emerging within the fast-moving consumer goods industry as barriers to entry in that market are falling. And then, yeah, definitely, it'll be a margin driver, because it allows us to deliver our services to clients in a much more efficient manner. And then finally, it'll bring more of our analytics revenues into the subscription model, which also makes them stickier and a more stable revenue stream for our business."
1,"And it certainly doesn't hurt when you have reference after reference among my executive peers in terms of how that has helped them. The immediate lift that we have seen is already quantifiable in the first year and what we feel that that will allow us to do, the lever what we feel we are going to do really well in customer engagement and keep pace with what we'll need to keep pace with the digital movement is pretty exciting to us."
1,"And it has been, and our view will continue to be that we want to return a fair amount of capital to shareholders, and that's been our practice. I think we have one of the strongest buybacks in the industry, but we've also said that when we have opportunities for M&A, we will be disciplined about these opportunities, but if we see opportunities to accelerate things that are strategic to us, we will do that. And that philosophy has not fundamentally changed by the benefit we're getting from the change in tax legislation."
1,"And it took us a long time to basically   and this is a statistical dynamic model. But what that allows us to do is in places where we're offering the quality of experience greater than three or four, this is one to five score, basically our churn falls in the range of 1% to 1. 3%, which is exactly where we want to run our business."
1,"And it will be a game changer. That will allow us to compete in the European market that really values those lightweight grade at a cost structure that helps us to be profitable from day one and gaining all that integrated margin that as a pure converter we weren't getting. So, yes, we're going to continue to accommodate and invest to meet our customer's demand."
1,"And it's also a number of company   another company now has filed for Chapter 11 in December, which is another sign that the players who do not develop a business in the way that we try to do, they are suffering the pain and   and pain in Spain, meaning that they are getting basically out of business. But we continue to drive our strategy and investing in security solutions and technology and that pays off and allows us to grow faster than the market in average in Spain and Portugal, so very encouraging to see that. Also good growth in most of the countries in Latin America, a bit of a struggle in Argentina where we have a negative net change in our portfolio and also less inflation in the price increases because of lower inflation rates in Argentina."
1,"And it's not   and because of the size of what it is today, it's not having material impact on the core. And so, we're learning more and more everyday about putting the strategies in place and the capabilities in place to accelerate that growth, but we still feel confident that there's a significant opportunity there, but we haven't characterized that specifically."
1,"And it's our job to provide them with both of those whenever we can. And we also recognize there's a significant opportunity to improve the appeal of our entry-level products and tailor marketing to entry-level customers so that we can significantly grow the percentage of new customers we get every year because the data shows that many of those customers grow into repeat customers over time. So we have to do a better job of not only being appealing to and marketing to the high end of our market, but we also have to address the entry level and in many markets, we see significant opportunities to do that."
1,"And I've already talk to you about how important RF is for us, both in aerospace and defense and on the commercial side. It allows us to move into the several commercial opportunities. Anaren is already involved in build to spec opportunities in the optical networking space, and we're seeing the same kind of frequency movement up to 77 gigahertz now for automotive, complexity is going up there."
1,"And just one last comment to that is we talked about our CapEx in the plan and we've got about $125 million of CapEx that we have identified so far and gotten approval for 2018, but that number is likely to change as we go forward and we see opportunities to put our money to work with the best returns."
1,"And just to add to what Howard said, as we're also planning these large Phase 3 trials, we also have embedded accelerated pathways to approval and those are with the patients who have actually relapsed or refractory to I-O agent. So we've created a clinical development plan that will allow us to move fast towards registration as well as those that will secure our position for first-line treatment."
1,"And just to give you one example, we've recently launched our own version of Google's Associate Product Owner Program and we've already got a pipeline of very exciting new talent from that program as well. And to make all of this work and to leverage our talent pool, we have built an operating model that allows us to innovate, manage our teams globally and also leverage our learnings across the entire network."
1,"And just yesterday we sort of clarified our position. So, we are going to move from having three phosphate operations to two, and we're going to repurpose our Redwater facility to an ammonium sulfate plant, and that will allow us to run Aurora and White Springs at much higher utilization rates, driving down our per-unit cost, and still allow us to service our Western Canadian customers, but also double our capacity in ammonium sulfate, which is a premium business. That's what we're focused on right now, and we've got a lot of people that are dedicated to that project; and that will get us the $80 million of synergies by the end of next year, and it's highly   that plan is highly capital efficient."
1,"And last week, dmg media announced the integration of Metro and Mail newspapers of their commercial operations. This is going to deliver an improved service to customers and also allows us to take advantage of our scale to save costs. In the operations bucket, Landmark redesigned the sales and customer service functions to deliver efficiency and effectiveness."
1,"And lastly, Precision's 2018 expected performance also reflects a slightly lower automotive build rate than what was forecasted at the time of acquisition. We feel confident that based on Precision's booked business and future opportunities, both their top line and bottom line will grow at near double-digit rates over the next few years, based on current projected build rates. For the full year of 2018, we expect AK Steel's capital investments to be around $160 million, this amount could be adjusted based upon changes in marketing conditions or operational needs."
1,"And look, we   at the same time, we do watch competitive moves and what's going on in different categories, which we'll continue to do this year. But we feel confident in the strength of our pipeline, as we've talked about. Again, whether it's in Pharma, with the very high number of line extensions or products we expect to launch over the next several years, or in our Medical Device space or in Consumer."
1,"And number five, and certainly last, but not least, Eatin' Good In The Neighborhood has clarified our brand position as a point of difference, and it's really resonated with our guests. As highlighted in the release, our one-time contribution to the ad fund will allow us to support marketing propositions with proper testing, advertising production, digital and social media, while increasing our number of on-air weeks. Now, on the portfolio front, I've mentioned previously the likelihood of some very selective consolidation among existing franchisees, as well as the introduction of perhaps a new franchisee to the brand."
1,"And of course, that EPI passes right through to the non-integrated liquid epoxy resin producers. So, we believe that combination of stronger environmental regulations by the Chinese government, combined with a much tighter market for EPI and LER, will allow us to continue to see pricing improvements like you saw in the second half of last year and in the fourth quarter."
1,"And on Ghana, we're very clear, we are partners that we have some time ahead of us to tap into the merger opportunities, strengthen our business. And from there on, it is quite clear that we strategically will try to make that business one that allows us to reallocate capital."
1,"And on January 11, we completed our acquisition of X15 Software, a technology startup with a big data platform capable of monitoring, searching, and analyzing data on a massive scale. The X15 platform allows us to extend Helix to on-premise deployments and to a more diverse range of cloud platforms, such as AWS, Microsoft, Oracle, and others. The X15 technology will be a large part of the foundation for our platform and analytics capabilities going forward, I'd like to welcome the X15 team to team FireEye."
1,"And on page 11, we show how we are planning to get our target of â‚¬20 billion of NPEs and â‚¬10 billion of NPLs by 2020. We have identified specific resolution strategies which are being executed diligently and in combination with our inorganic initiatives, I am confident that will allow us to surpass our targets. On page 12, we outlined the NPL sale processes that are currently underway and are expected to be concluded by the end of the second quarter of 2018."
1,"And on the cash flows, the transaction is immediately accretive, 5% year one post-signing and 15% at full run rate. This allows us to guide towards a meaningful upside on the dividends for 2018 where we are now guiding that subject to closing up the transaction this year. Dividends for the year will be DKK 1."
1,"And on the share buyback front, we're constantly watching the share price relative to our intrinsic value calculations. If we see opportunities we will certainly repurchase shares in the fourth quarter of the year. We repurchased approximately $300 million in shares."
1,"And once the FDA, if the FDA approves us, once they take that action, we'll be in a position to act very rapidly to gain access and reimbursement through all of the appropriate channels and key customers. We feel confident that in BRAF-mutant melanoma, there's already a deep understanding of the impressive activity of MEK and BRAF combination therapy in general. And so, we aren't necessarily educating about a brand new market, we're simply educating about a new potential therapy that has what we believe very impressive activity and very competitive safety profile."
1,"And once we launch that at Stuttgart, that's kind of going in line with our marketing book buildup. But again, we don't go into specific, like, prospects that we have in the pipeline, but again we have our enterprise accounts and we have some significant opportunity to land there."
1,"And one of our focus areas is on the integrated fulfillment, continuing to reinvent how we make it easier and easier to plug into the SPS Commerce network. And then, our last product that we have had some success, it's still early, is our assortment product, which allows us to take product information and data and house it for the supplier in one spot and share it with the different retailers in a different spot. Again, that's a couple percent of revenue, but I think over time that will become more and more meaningful."
1,"And our global pipeline is nearly 1,200 stores. Outlook for our International business is very robust with significant opportunities for growth as we continued to expand the brand through our differentiation of quality, technology and strong unit economics. However, in North America, the negative 3."
1,"And perhaps, even more important, we have a leadership team in place that is focused on intensive teamwork and on collectively delivering result in both the short and the longer term. So, in conclusion, I have been in the CEO seat for over two years and I'm confident on our strategy to build-out a unique set of capabilities will allow us to compete at the highest levels to address the needs of our surgeons and the clinical and economics dynamics of this marketplace. The combination of our cutting-edge implant portfolio, our leadership in MIS, especially in lateral; the newly introduced Surgical Intelligence Platform; and a robust services business moves us even farther on our path to having a fully integrated procedural offering and positions us to execute well in this evolving healthcare environment."
1,"And quite frankly, the order book, which we announced when we bought the company, was very strong at that point and in the relatively short time we've owned it less than one quarter, that order book has risen materially. And so, we see opportunities in the existing markets where we are now. And those would be most of the large Canadian cities, but centered in the Toronto market, the Pacific Northwest, Northern California and to a lesser extent, in the Northeast in New York and Washington D."
1,"And quite frankly, we've seen others in our category who have made gains in these other meal periods, which we think clearly should be within our bailiwick because we got a better product, better restaurant, and better experience and so, we see that as a significant opportunity for growth. And we've seen it in others and we believe we should own it."
1,"And really investing from a position of strength, we're very confident about our business model and our growth potential. But continuing to invest and may be doing it at an accelerated pace allows us to adapt to the increased pace of change I thing that's happening in guest expectations in retail. So, if we only solved for margin, I think, we would not maximize the opportunity that's ahead of us."
1,"And since this is very software-driven, it structurally also contributes to the non-EUV business being up. So, both effects   both of these businesses go up based on the products that we offer and then you also have a mix-based effect and that, of course, comes together with us making significant progress on EUV and that's why we feel confident that from the 45% we can advance in 2018 and then get to our 50% plus in 2020."
1,"And so having some way to capture that wealth was really important to us. So through the acquisition of TCA, ultimately we'll set up a referral program where hopefully we can look to emerging wealth peers and those that might be entering or will in due course, need or likely look to an advisor and hopefully we can provide them with an alternative which will allow us to capture some of the economics as opposed to none of the economics."
1,"And so I think you need to think about the two of those in conjunction. And the adding of the salespeople really on a more very targeted basis is all around trying to improve our position in certain markets where we believe we've got significant opportunities. And given our share position relatively in the industry, we've got plenty of room to grow and we've talked about that."
1,"And so that's one thing, it's a trade area expansion, because as many of you know, most people shop grocery five to seven minutes from where they live. This allows us to capture customers outside that seven minute trade area, so that's great. Second is, we think of home delivery as, we want to be where the customer wants us to be."
1,"And so to the extent that we had safety or reliability in the other projects that we might have otherwise have pushed out to another year, it creates an opportunity to invest in those projects. We've kind of estimated that as, I don't know, a couple of CAD 300 million a year over the next four or five years, so it is a significant opportunity. Obviously we have to continue to be prudent with our investment from our customers' perspective."
1,"And so to the extent that we traded below book, I think we would be active buyers of that, of the stock below whenever trades below book value. And if we need more capital, we see opportunities, there's dislocations. I think the capital markets have been good to us."
1,"And so we will have our product managers alongside our sales people understanding how that product fits into their workflow understanding value of their product, understanding how they will perform as they consume it in. So that really does drive that product development that also allows us to establish the value for that product. So it's a good   and we lead with our technology but at the same time we use our customers and we've seen a lot of that in understanding how customers will use the products."
1,"And so we're constantly working with them strategically on what's the right staffing model, what are the right opportunities, what subsidies are required depending on the payer mix or the service mix of a particular facility or market. And we think we have a unique opportunity because we have critical mass in a lot of markets that allows us to work with them productively. Do we have a little pressure on costs?"
1,"And so when we think about localization and international activity, what we're focused on   well, how did that develop, and is that representative of our fair share on market in those regions, and in those countries? And what we see is that while we have very good representation, we see a significant opportunity in major markets in Asia Pacific, Latin America, or even within Europe. And so how will we manifest that growth into the proposal or if you would the opportunity into a reality?"
1,"And so, from that perspective, it caters to people who want to enjoy, hang out, and this has been very helpful, again, based on our high street and shopping mall locations. So, significant opportunity. Very excited."
1,"And so, having this capability   and it is a little more complicated, you actually have to use a lot more hedging capability to make sure that you've appropriately factored in the volatility of the payouts. But having that capability, which we've developed will allow us to take advantage of a market opportunity, where there is a lot for sale and very few buyers. So, we will be able to be   and pursue these in a very value-oriented way."
1,"And so, in Lids, we've talked to you also about a robotic picking system that we have implemented in the warehouse. It's a big grid that has 144,000 bin locations that move to the picker and that allows us to process e-commerce orders really the same day and get the product out as quickly as we can. In Journeys this year, we have invested in not only in expansion but in a special system to focus on the expediting of e-commerce orders as well."
1,"And so, it is   there's no doubt that what we've done in terms of moving up the stack is differentiating our managed communication service, and it's beginning to contribute more significantly on the revenue and margin line. So we'll continue with that focus on a go-forward basis because of both of those things, that, one, it really allows us to maximize revenue on a per site basis; and number two, it is differentiating our managed communication services business."
1,"And so, it's really creative and incentive for governments to pursue countrywide eradication programs where they can deploy rapid screening technologies to identify those individuals who are infected, get them on drug, cure them in as little as 8 to 12 weeks, and avoid the significant morbidity and mortality costs associated with later-stage chronic hepatitis C infection. So, a significant opportunity for the company and we continue to pursue multiple opportunities around the world. I mentioned we've developed a stable   this is kind of a hybrid now, this is a specimen stabilization reagent which was developed out of our molecular business, but it's directed to high burden infectious disease, tuberculosis."
1,"And so, it's very much this whole notion of the converging physical and digital infrastructure. We see ourselves as a leader in that space over the next couple of years, and this full lifecycle IT capability will allow us to do that. So with that, about on time, I think, to go to questions."
1,"And so, look, really coming out of the first quarter of 2017, we saw a significant opportunity to change the way we leverage our marketing spend. We had an opportunity to improve our value perception and better engage with customers in the moments that matter throughout their home improvement journey."
1,"And so, one of the key opportunities for us and one of the reasons we're considering   or have considered the rights offering is being able to have greater dry powder to execute on that and to facilitate growth on our 3D ventures. With our new facility and the roll-out there, we anticipate having a dedicated really building within a building that will allow us to facilitate some development and production of top secret or similar type parts for aerospace and government-oriented entities. And so, that's a tremendous opportunity and one we're very excited about, still on the come, if you will, but nonetheless we are moving in that direction with great efficiency."
1,"And so, our ability to leverage the analytics inside our ti. com machine in combination with our sales team, it just allows us to get to a diverse set of customers which lines up great. It really, really   those competitive advantages actually line up best for industrial given the fragmentation and the various sizes of customers and end equipments, it actually lines up best for us than any other market that's out there."
1,"And so, regardless of whether that applications, that server farm sits in an AWS environment or it sits in a traditional data center, we can now cost effectively get visibility into that application. So, that allows us to tap into new areas, new budgets, new buyers that we couldn't necessarily get into previously. So, I think that we're still early days in that the products were introduced last summer."
1,"And so, that whole connection piece we view as an another way for us to make connection with our sales force and for our consumers to make a connection with our sales force as well. And so, the digital tools will allow us to make her life easier. We are implementing new systems, front end and back end that will help us to better support her, to reduce the administration and to take her out of the office and to put her on revenue generating activities, so she can spend more time."
1,"And so, there's a lot of opportunity for integration and there's a lot of opportunity also to change the payment model, which today rewards a fee-for-service mindset. And so, what we want to do with Kindred is to fundamentally change that, restructure the deal the way we did, we think, in a very low-risk way by breaking up the company, which allows us to focus on the part of the business that we're interested in, which is the home health and hospice piece, take a 40% stake in that business to allow our sponsor partners who we feel very good about, allow them to focus on the fee-for-service side of the business to making sure that business stays strong while we can focus on the fundamental business transformation and that's where we're going to focus without being distracted by integration. Over time, as this business proceeds and our model continues to get better, over time, we can think about bringing the whole asset in or if it doesn't work, we can always sell it."
1,"And so, those planes will essentially replace North American flying. And as I mentioned in my comments, the range of 737 allows us to go from Eastern Canada to Europe to Western Europe, and also from Western Canada to Hawaii. It's much more efficient and we have a lot more opportunities to fly a narrow-body across the ocean to those markets than a wide-body."
1,"And so, we can manage a lot of the issues that customers have, that I'll talk about later around why this breakage. The other piece that I wanted to highlight here is we have this enhanced insulation capability by having a first-party installing with Verengo, they allows us to make sure that we service our highest value customer here, grow as possible, we can design that customer experience and how things actually happen on the roof. It allows us to also use that platform to drive cross-sells going forward through other products, and so that's a high value addition to the platform that we acquired from SunEdison."
1,"And so, we made very nice progress. We recognize though that there's still very significant opportunity to continue to drive that kind of diversification. Truthfully, the challenge might be, if upstream oil and gas continues to be robust, the challenge might be keeping the focus on those other types of demand."
1,"And so, we're very excited about that opportunity. We think we have a significant opportunity to grow. As Mike said, it will take a little time."
1,"and South Korea and the rapidly emerging energy-as-a-service marketplace, that is contributing to the growth of our generation portfolio, enhancing margins and revenue. The unique pairing of our versatile fuel cell technology and flexible business model allows us to provide comprehensive innovative solutions that solve customers' business, energy, and environmental problems in unique ways. Recent projects demonstrated how FuelCell Energy is providing affordable clean, and, reliable distributed generation for utilities, municipalities, and industrial customers as a service, rather than a mere commodity."
1,"And that all helps us create a long-term sustained growth business. That allows us to think differently about how we invest in productivity and cash performance as well. It gets into production rate discipline, how we drive our R&D programs, feather our R&D investments, how we engage with our workforce, and see those actions are beginning to hit the bottom line."
1,"And that basically, that's something that my team is responsible for and has control over and there's a lot we're doing actually to embrace that feedback we've gotten and I think get a lot better. So, number one, we're building in a new technology platform, a customer success platform that integrates with our athenaNet data that allows us to surface up in real time proactive insights around our clients' performance and get ahead of any issues that they might have. Second, I'm relatively new here, I've been here six months, part of why I came in is to help transform the way that we serve our clients."
1,"And that doesn't even count the ability to take some of the Dow Ag traits and reduce some of the royalty payments that the new Corteva company is going to have to pay externally over the next 5 to 7 to 10 years. That's clearly a longer-term play, but there is a significant opportunity for Ag in that space. Then when you look at the Specialty Division, we're growing."
1,"And that means over this time period, we will have generated more than $2 billion in total savings from FORCE and the restructuring program to help us drive sales, to handle commodity cost increases and currency changes, and to improve our margins. So these savings will allow us to do the following things. First, we'll be able to invest more to drive our top line growth, and those investments will be focused on strengthening and growing our core businesses, accelerating our Personal Care growth opportunities in developing and emerging markets, and further building our digital and e-commerce capabilities."
1,"And that requires heavy-lifting and hard work, because it is at the end a relationship that has transitioned across multiple corporate entities, from EDS to HP to DXC. So aspirationally, from a modeling perspective, even if we continue to grow this business at market, I think that provides significant opportunity for us to   for the company overall to grow, keep growing above market. And I think that's the way we're thinking about it, from a two to three-year plan perspective."
1,"And that will   that is a perpetual kind of focus in the company. And if we see opportunities to harness the strengths of the company, whether they're technology strengths of the company, whether they're operational strengths of the company, whether they're channel strengths of the company or all of the above in what we've called adjacent markets, and adjacency is defined around by   defined around what we are, right? And I think it's really important to recognize what we are."
1,"And that will help with also efficiency, think about population of models, data intake and so on that will be more automated so that our analysts can focus on more the higher value-added work going forward. So those are clear areas where we see opportunities in Ratings going forward. With respect to foreign exchange rates, let me give you a couple of perspectives."
1,"And that's evolving here, but also in other countries as well. So, as we go into 2018, we've built plans to continue to focus around our core products, but also the new and innovative products, like the Soleil Balance that you mentioned that will allow us to drive consumer awareness, preference, and purchase. And we'll evolve those as market conditions evolve."
1,"And that's important because you'll remember that KALYDECO, we actually did a 48-week efficacy endpoint because we just didn't know what the efficacy profiles would look like on these CFTR modulators. We've done this so many times now that we know that you see maximal efficacy very, very quickly which is what allows us to progress the trials a lot faster than we have before."
1,"And that's just the math and the reality of the situation. But with T-Mobile, again, what was our disadvantage is a significant opportunity in the future. What we did in the last five years was a distribution footprint that was only two-thirds of America because that's where our network was, with no low-band asset and a business case to really build out the extensive geography in the U."
1,"And that's where we're going to continue to enhance our dominance, used comes along with it. At the same time we see opportunities to inject more transparency into the used car transaction, be a tool that enables the dealers to explain their cars better and we've got some experiments going on around that. They also should be able to bring more independent dealers into our network to bring along the longer tail, small dealers that have smaller inventories, that price points that are very attractive."
1,"And the board just approved a 800,000 share buyback for the year 2018 that we hope to effect. In terms of debt and our thoughts about debt, yes, you are right, we are delevered but we're not adverse to debt if there were opportunities, strategic opportunities that were out there from a bolt-on perspective, as Eric mentioned, or if we see opportunities to invest elsewhere in our network, we certainly will do that. And as I said, we're not debt adverse, we just happen to be in a delevered state right now."
1,"And the existing fiber doesn't have that capacity. So, what we have allows us to go deploy a lot of small cells on our fiber and we have lots of that latent capacity still there, lots of strands of fiber that haven't been used for anything yet. And that allows for us to get those incremental yields that I talked about."
1,"And the lower tax rate has not changed our underwriting. If we're going to save $20 million or $25 million in taxes in 2018, that capital will just go back into the business, it will allow us to do four, five, six more communities, help us with our growth and employ more people and take more advantage of this housing market."
1,"And the reason for that is that second bullet point in the upper right hand corner. We see opportunities to drive organic growth, right and that is the way and the only reason you would see us increased our expenses is to really drive those things. But again from a dollar amount standpoint, this is prior to NPH."
1,And the strategic investment in Energous is gathering momentum following the FCC approval of the WattUp Mid Field transmitter. The investment helps us to address the significant opportunity in the wireless charging market and we have a full product road map ready to deliver. Let's now take a closer look at 2018 growth drivers on slide 10.
1,"And the third thing we believe in is the ability for remote monitoring. There is a lot of technology coming out today that is device-enabled that allows us to be able to predict if someone is   how they're sleeping, if they're sleeping elevated, does that mean there are something going on that they cannot breathe and COPD is being expressed in a different way. And our ability to have an intervention there, the ability for us to monitor their drug intake to the ability for us to also understand things like their weight gain."
1,"And then adjusted EPS, you could see we grew it by 115% and we think there's a good opportunity to continue to grow that both organically as well as through smart, strategic, accretive acquisitions. So, we think we've put together a unique business model that allows us to grow both organically and inorganically at high profit margins. And so, what we did is we compared ourselves to effectively all the publicly traded companies with market caps between $750 million and $3 billion and that's what this chart shows."
1,"And then also investing in restaurant technology, which we believe is the key to making our existing locations more productive. It started with the implementation of KDS about six quarters ago in the heart of the house and now changes to our food cost management system, changes to the newest version of our Aloha point-of-sale system, making changes to the technology that servers use in the restaurant, all will allow us to be more productive and provide for a better guest experience. And then lastly, those revolutionary approaches that will allow us to become a growth company again, not something that we're yet ready to talk about today, but we're doing a lot of work over the next year."
1,"And then by that not only mitigating and compensating that erosion, but also leveraging that strategy on a group margin basis. So, that will work over time, I'm sure, plus that it allows us to grow faster than the market."
1,"And then in some of the emerging markets, we haven't seen anything necessarily changing there as well. And as the emerging markets become more industrialized, we see opportunities overall for our products in those markets beyond just the MFAs. So when we look at the MFAs overall, while we don't expect them to grow at the overall pace of the animal health market, we do expect them to grow but in the lower single digits."
1,"And then just a second question. We've heard from a lot of your competitors sort of on your electrical architecture side that there may be some significant opportunities as we go to Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous, meaning there's just a whole tear-up and restructuring of the electrical platform, if you will, in the vehicle. I mean, how much of an opportunity is that for you?"
1,"And then of course in China and in Asia as you know, we should grab the position and continue being a leading brand in that Asia. So it's not one thing that we are working with, but it's more continuous improvement, but we see opportunities and we will try to work on that. But a clear one is of course to further distance ourselves from our local competitors by introducing the Nederman Insight, introducing sales tools like we have quotation tools, simplifying for the customer, how to make life easier for them, quicker for architect, et cetera."
1,"And then telecommunications and fiber-to-the-home, we have   these are relatively small businesses for AOI. We see opportunities however in telecommunications in things like 5G, front-haul and back-haul, backbone networks for Internet datacenter connectivity and increasing reliability of access networks. So, we see companies like Verizon and others that have infrastructure that is in need of upgrade increasingly being   replacing copper connections with fiber optic connections either all the way to the home or at least to a node somewhere in the neighborhood that can be facilitated that   the transport of data to the home can then be facilitated over DSL or what have you."
1,"And then the last category around growth is about a $40 billion TAM today and frankly our belief is it's going to grow pretty significantly, but it's made up of three different things and we're bringing disruptive technology to 3D printing, as well as immersive computing around virtual reality and 3D scanning. So, we think that there are really significant opportunities both in the short term to continue to drive the here and now, but also investing for the long term."
1,"And then the oil side again I think you're kind of in the 15% range maybe 20%, it really depends again on the opportunity. And I think that where we see opportunities to expand our strategic footprint to satisfy customer demand in the basin whether it would be Hess demand or third-party demand, we're going to go after it. So as long as it makes sense from an investment perspective and is accretive to the midstream, we're going to aggressively target   target third parties."
1,And then the other piece that plays into that is all the work we've done on the breeding automation and the seed chippers. The use of markers is so effective today that we can analyze those crosses in those kernels coming right out of the greenhouse which allows us to dramatically expand our testing capability. So that's what's driving the gain in the new releases.
1,"And then the third piece is getting what you want. So, if you think of what we're building out, it's the marketplace to guarantee depth of selection, Mercado Pago which allows us to control payments, and eventually MercadoEnvÃ­os which we talked about for logistics. So it's fundamental for us just in ensuring conversion rates and the best possible user experience on our retail business."
1,"And then there's automotive. This market has been a focus for Cypress for over a decade, and we have a solid plan to continue growing our share and expanding our content at existing customers with a significant opportunity in connectivity. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and USB-C are all seeing a rapid increase in their attach rates, approaching 100% in new automotive designs."
1,"And then, we have dormitories currently at three of our existing parks that allow us to really go out and attract an employment or an employee base from a broader market. It's what allows us to activate the J-1 Visa program. So we've been in the process of evaluating the potential for dormitories at more parks."
1,"And therefore, we will not now give sub-guidance on the subdivision some of DHL. But of course, we see a significant opportunity to improve the performance of DGFF. This is a good question."
1,"And there's a lot of synergy   one of the things we've said about our Permian position is our ability to grow off the footprint that we have there. And so, our ability to leverage existing assets allows us to get those type of returns. And so, by being very focused on going after and working with the top-tier producers in the acreage that surrounds our assets and lets us accomplish and get those returns."
1,"And this is even before the product gets to the independent distributor. So we see significant cost synergy opportunity in the distribution side of the business, we also see opportunity in procurement, we see supply-chain opportunities, we see opportunities in a number of other areas. So we remain highly confident that we can get to the synergy targets that we've talked about with you before."
1,"And this is not just the account managers, it's applications engineers, it's engineers, people that can go work with these key equipment makers and get in very early in the development process to give them solutions that they wouldn't get with any other valve supplier. Having that depth of knowledge close to our customers gives us a chance to win most of the battles and also allows us to interface with the technologies we have back in Switzerland to get the right solution as quickly as possible for those OEMs. And it's that fast cycle landing rate that helps them develop equipment and it helps us drive our business."
1,"And this means partnering with our communities where we operate to ensure that we achieve safe production, protect the environment and execute consistently on our business plan. We're focused on both technical and organic growth as you see and we've got significant opportunities. While we're executing on these geological opportunities, we'll also be looking at what we can do to retool or re-augment our capacity."
1,"And this transaction removes our exposure to selling market into the unpredictable external markets while securing supply of our own paper needs. The cash proceeds will allow us to strengthen our balance sheet on top of the Â£70 million reduction in the pension deficit which we announced at the half-year results in November. Also, at the half year results, we said that we would continue to increase investment in product development, in new technologies, and in sales capabilities to drive growth."
1,"And through that efficiency gain, we can afford to now redeploy some of those sales resources into the high-growth channels that we outlined in terms of the DI and LDM opportunities. And so, that will allow us to accelerate growth in new channels while getting and creating efficiencies in our core business."
1,"And through these platforms, we've created a community of stakeholders who continuously interact with one another. This allows us to continue to serve our core customers as well as provides with an opportunity to extend into adjacent segments. We are currently a B2B platform and a fast-paced business."
1,"And to that, I can say that we have a very flexible business model, we have a very strong balance sheet. And if the market improves, and if we see opportunities that satisfies our very strict criteria to returns, we can certainly increase that during the year. But as it is right now, and as we see the world right now, 206 days is what we plan for, for 2018."
1,"And to your KeyLemon earn-out question, obviously, we're very excited about this transaction because it allows us to enter the whole Android market in Asia with our 3D sensing capabilities. This is now coming at the right time because it adds the software component to our hardware expertise."
1,"And today, in North America, with the power cost advantage that we have here in the United States, that's come about because of the shale revolution in natural gas and crude oil. With the improved regulatory situation that we now have, and with a very flexible workforce which allows us to deal with changes in our business, whether we're expanding or having to reallocate resources, the support we get from states, from local communities, it's a big advantage of investing in the United States, which is still, from a political risk standpoint, the best country in the world. And now with this new tax bill, that's another advantage now."
1,"And today, the size of Brazil, the size of Spain will be much higher in our portfolio. And so, we have doubled the size of countries with higher level of organic growth than the rest of the group, so it will allow us to improve for the whole group the organic growth. And the third topic is coming from the four months of Berendsen countries that will impact our organic growth in 2018."
1,and traditional wealth was up 9% in the quarter and had a good quarter. So we see opportunity there. We're driving on the expense side as well and we expect to have more to say about that as we move through the year and that will help drive the operating leverage.
1,"And we always take a look at them and, of course, keep up with the literature. I would say one of the great things about Cpf1 and the family of PAM variance that we already in-licensed over a year ago, is when we add up all of their PAM recognition capabilities, that allows us to actually cut at almost every base in the entire human genome. So, the way we've tackled the problem of flexibility of targeting is by bringing in and reducing to practice sort of a large suite of enzymes that gives us a very diverse portfolio of size that we can target within the human genome, right."
1,"And we are anticipating approximately $550 million in sales and $68 million in EBITDA in the first 12 months. The combined resources of Applied and FCX will make us a leading technical solutions provider with significant opportunities for growth. Now at this time, Dave and I will turn to the slide deck to provide some additional comments and color on this pending acquisition."
1,"And we are creating new opportunities through new business models, often helped by the Unilever Foundry. This allows us to collaborate with start-ups, matching our brands to leading technologies. Like CIF's new partnership with an on-demand home cleaning company or Hellmann's first foray into the direct-to-consumer space, piloting with a start-up company to deliver fresh ingredients to consumers on demand."
1,"And we are expanding our investment in renewable energy. Our Florida multi-year rate plan allows us to build up to 700 megawatts of new solar generation in the state. Combined with the procurement of almost 2,700 megawatts of solar in North Carolina under HB 589, we are clearly making progress on our carbon reduction goal."
1,"And we are strengthening our convenience store offering to capture higher margins on increased sales of convenience side, and it's kind of an untapped opportunity in the company that we've never fully taken full advantage of. And so, we have a very clear plan in Marketing which allows us to go in and drive this profitability in Marketing. And then finally we are, we entered Mexico at the end of last summer, and I'm going to share with you just a little bit about Mexico from a Marketing standpoint."
1,"And we believe there's a huge business to build there. One of the next steps in building the Canadian business is to build our own logistics infrastructure in Canada, which allows us to bring product in container direct from our suppliers direct into Canada and reduce the duties we pay and therefore lower the prices for our Canadian customers. UK and Germany, very different markets and very different places."
1,"And we certainly built the technology for it. And now, we're looking forward to populate that with good data that will allow us to better tailor our product to the customer needs."
1,"And we do expect free cash flow to accelerate in 2018, 2019 and 2020 as a result of the organic and inorganic investments we've made in growth and in the operating model. So, we're very excited about the future of the firm and the catalytic event that 2017 was for us in selling our outsourcing assets, which allows us to invest so much more into higher revenue growth, higher margin, and higher free cash flow businesses. So, with that, we'd be delighted to take your questions."
1,"And we don't believe that you get too in love with any type of deal or that you chase a deal that could be to the detriment of the overall long-term performance of the company. So, we'll continue to look, monitor, and where we see opportunities, we'll pursue them."
1,"And we expect though from our actual capacity increase in terms of fleets, we're probably looking at something more like in the mid-single digits, will make some more like 5% rather than 15% improvement in our capacity. It will allow us to more consistently work on larger and more intense jobs, which is a net positive. But it won't result in a 15% increase in our number of fleet."
1,"And we expect to see a nice bounce back in the market in terms of volume in the March and April timeframe. And with TRULANCE now approved in both CIC and IBS-C, along with growing brand awareness and expanded market access, we have a significant opportunity to drive further growth in the coming quarters. One of our key launch objectives was to establish a strong foundation with the most productive and influential prescribers."
1,"And we generate operating cash flow. We also generate portfolio proceeds which come about from assets that we sell where we see opportunities to optimize our fleet and that's mostly here in North America. So, as you can see from the table on the right hand side, regardless of the cycle, we are generating substantial amounts of cash off of our long-lived assets."
1,"And we have further plans to do it this year. In addition to that, increase in volume of production in Tambov next year will allow us to spread our fixed administrative cost more evenly and we believe will further drive the improvement in our margins. So given the current prices, which we today have on the market for grain and soya, we believe that our business might come to the marginality of 35%."
1,"And we have seen repeat buys as a result of the strong completion and viability metrics. In 2018, as you heard Spence earlier, we are expecting only a modest bottom line contribution from ads as we plan to ramp the video ads opportunity and as we continue to invest in the significant opportunity for the long-term. For the second part of the question, I will hand over to Coddy."
1,"And we look forward to updating key wins throughout the course of 2018 with some, we believe, potentially coming quite soon. With Noctiva, we have a significant opportunity that we believe will be a major catalyst for Avadel as the only product approved and proven to effectively treat nocturia as a highly prevalent and highly bothersome condition. As we continue to learn more, prepare and execute our plans, we've only become more confident and bullish on this opportunity for Avadel, the patients we serve, and our shareholders."
1,"And we made important strategic and capital reallocation decisions. And Jim Hackett initiated and is championing our global fitness reset and re-design initiatives, which are yielding, as he said, significant opportunities that will improve the business going forward. So, we're looking forward to 2018."
1,And we really think about this from three perspectives. The first is to dominate the learning market and we believe with the holistic strategy and the holistic solution we are offering combination of the state-of-the-art learning management system with best-in-class learning experience combined with a highly disruptive content subscription offering gives us a competitive advantage that will allow us to continue to grow in this market. And it's a growing market that is still highly fragmented.
1,"And we think about it, we think about the opportunity in four buckets, and each one has a pretty substantial incremental sales associated with them. The first one is really around the digital platform that allows us to engage our mom. This wraps around improvements in foundational features like optimized check out, enhanced search, easier access to accounts, easier access to rewards, and then a streamlined sign up for our private label credit card and MPR, and we started to work on improved product recommendations."
1,"And we think that's very important. AOI has developed a platform technology that we've been able to utilize at 40 gigabits per second, 100 gigabit per second, 200 gigabits, and 400 gigabits per second, and having that installed base of equipment, manufacturing capability, and the know-how that's associated with manufacturing these types of modules, allows us to not only develop products faster, but also bring them to market faster and ramp them faster as well as maintaining a relatively low cost while we're doing so because we're not reinventing that technology, reinventing the wheel and having to go back and re-engineer our manufacturing process as we continue to ramp. And finally, another sort of structural difference is that the manufacturing model because of the rapid movement and the need for flexibility in this market, right?"
1,"And we think they position us very well going into 2018. And of course, if you add on to that the Actelion effect, where we also see a significant opportunity to reach more patients, to ensure that there is more patients are on multiple drug regimens earlier in the disease process that we can expand Actelion's reach globally, as well as seek new indications. When we put all of things together, combined with some of the new approvals that we're expecting   we're very excited about apalutamide."
1,"And we were able to do a couple of good transactions, the latter part of 2017 with a partial sale of DRA, swappings in the property interest with our Conshohocken venture to exit that, as well as on the Allstate side, sell out of the property in Bethesda and took really advantage of the strong investment market there. So I do think that as we said on previous calls, we think a lot of heavy lifting is behind us in terms of the portfolio repositioning, but I do think it's incumbent upon us to always be very mindful of where we think these markets are going and to always staying close touch with capital sources in the investment market to make sure that we are in a position to respond as we see opportunities come up."
1,"And we were very pleased with the growth that we saw in our FSAFEDS Program where we saw more growth this year than I think that the FSAFEDS Program has seen in the last several years. And the one thing that came out of this year was we actually now see a window into continuing to offer programs that will allow us to continue to increase the penetration of this important account. And those of you who's been around and understand the number of eligibles within the FSAFEDS Program of over 2 million, there's a long runway for growth there that we're confident we're going to be able to capitalize on."
1,"And we will be taking a similar approach here, and therefore we've identified a number of opportunities to hedge, particularly the equity element within the transaction and the risk that comes from the fee structures that are driven by equity levels. Secondly, probably the next most important is strategic asset allocation within the annuity fund where we see opportunities to move towards Phoenix's approach to strategic asset allocation that will provide us with an uplift in benefit. And then there are a number of things we've identified, and it's early days, but if we think smartly about how we combine the businesses together from our diversification of risk perspective, we will see further opportunities that will give rise to capital benefits."
1,"And we would also bring in additional new equity in the form of cash and/or assets. When that agreement and all the conditions necessary for it to close are completed, we will be entering a new phase for Northern, one where our strengthened balance sheet will allow us to accelerate growth and re-establish Northern as the natural consolidator of non-operated working interest in the Williston Basin. We will look to continue to take advantage of the strengths of our non-operated business model, including utilizing the substantial database we have amassed from participating in over 3,500 wells in the basin; a strict focus on capital allocation; continuing to execute on our ground game acquisition strategy; and looking to the A&D market in order to further improve our total debt-to-EBITDA metrics."
1,"And we'll continue our progress in adding hydroxide capacity at the same rate as market growth. FMC's unique modular approach to adding capacity allows us to move quickly in small or large increments across multiple geographic locations. And importantly, we can time our expansions to match our customer contract profile while continuing to produce consistent quality and specifications from all of our units wherever they are located."
1,"And we're aiming for bolt-on acquisitions on companies that drive healthy marketing mix. So, yes, there will be investments but we feel confident that we can drive the successful implementation we had in the German-speaking countries also international. Potentially, also, using our media alliance and the media alliance partner somewhat to chip in, but there will be a bonus."
1,"And we're also going to increase the level of quality, especially as we move to the public cloud, but we're doing it in general just focusing on core metrics availability, performance, stuff that our customers globally really expect. And ultimately all of this is underpinned by a platform, commerce and data that allows us to bundle our offerings together and make that a seamless user experience. I'm going to spend a second here, talking about the public cloud decision that we made with Amazon."
1,"And we're also leveraging our sourcing capabilities for more efficient in-season replenishment. Also we see opportunities to deliver more fashion product to our smaller DXL stores, and we're getting better reads in what individual markets are capable of selling, which is enabling us to feed stores with the most appropriate assortments to satisfy demand and maximize productivity. We recognize that customer facing solutions are constrained by the foundational infrastructure that supports them."
1,"And we're looking at if we   we see opportunity if we get back one of the department stores' boxes and the team is actively looking on that, even though we have no indication that's going to happen."
1,"And we're looking forward to Brinker joining us shortly, that will round that team out. And as we complete the remaining steps of the repositioning, which I've heard from many investors that they're excited to get that done, we do think that it allows us to stabilize and we should be able to recapture some of the value that was lost. So that's how we're looking at it."
1,"And we've also completed securitization in the last half year. But that flexibility allows us to look forward with confidence that, if there are organic or inorganic growth opportunities, we have comfort that we'll be able to fund those given the structure of our balance sheet. The second aspect I'd like to highlight is the strong composition of call deposits within our funding mix positions us well to potentially benefit, if we do move to a tightening interest rate environment, at some stage in the future given the lower sensitivity of these deposits to rate changes will be a positive to margin."
1,"And we've also found historically when there's been merger and acquisition where they tend to want to consolidate or put more spends on to a fewer vendors, it plays to our strength, really reliable equipment that has high performance and really has a cost of ownership advantage to them. So, I think the ACG story is one thing that really allows us to say, if this would occur, it'll be mitigated by some of the change we've made in terms of the company's portfolio and capabilities we offer to the marketplace."
1,"And we've only been able to do that by increasing operating margins. And so for this year, our operating margins on the surface are flat versus 2017, but it's actually increasing on an organic basis, and that allows us to continue to invest in acquisitions and in other areas of the business. So, without the Black Duck acquisition which we closed at the end of Q1, operating margins were actually increasing."
1,"And what channel production is, it's important as we dedicate a   an espresso machine and a POS to Mobile Order & Pay and we dedicate an espresso machine and a POS to in-store traffic. And that allows us to move the in-store experience faster. So people perceive that things are going faster rather than in some stores today; it's just in the order that comes in."
1,"And what it does is it allows it to automate what we do every day in the field and to the product quicker   and now I don't want to get too nerdy, but I'm going to for a second because these folks, I can tell you, we're excited and talks about it. What X15 allows us to do is query data, get immediate results and the query language used is one all our consultants know. So if we're getting log-ons and failed log-ons into the bucket, we can write user behavior analytics on any accounts being abused."
1,"And what it means is that ultimately we intend to grow our bottom line, we intend to grow our cash flow at a faster rate than our top line. And Todd Edlund will provide actually some elements of the strategy that will allow us to control our cost structure to provide that leverage. And then, Greg Graves, our CFO, will actually drive you through the fairly comprehensive walk forward of what it means for the years to come."
1,"And what was happening, Doug, was I was getting and the team was getting inbound interest, and we weren't acknowledging whether we had a process going or not. And by nature of being able to put this in discontinued operations, it just allows us to have very robust discussions with interested parties. And it allows us to just kind of have it out there in the public domain, so that we can pursue whatever opportunities come our way as it relates to this."
1,"And what we have found is that there's been this explosion in new technologies that allow us to basically take some shortcuts and get things done more quickly than we were previously able to do, if we really adopt them in a thoughtful way. So cloud technology allows us to circumvent the hosting process because it provides infrastructure ready to go. And machine learning and artificial intelligence allows us to create algorithms that are smarter and that learn as the context around them changes."
1,"And what were the assumptions made when the pricing was put together, what were the expectations of our customer, and what were we   what are we doing. And it really allows us to take emotions out of conversation and it's all data and fact-based. So, we're seeing a significant opportunity in terms of having and changing the dialogue with our customers."
1,And what you can see here a little bit is that we shift for example Semicon & Science. We made the big growth is now 4% of our revenue but also we put more focus on District Energy & Gas and you'll see that we don't mention the name of the end market oil anymore because we see more opportunities in District Energy & Gas applications with a good margin than that we see opportunities in oil. It doesn't mean that we completely stop with oil.
1,"And whatever they're kind of pain points are, we're going to do everything we can to try to make them easier without giving up economic value. So, what we know is that the contract we have in place now allows us to make certain money for whatever we would provide for them on access to our towers, and we can always use that. That would be a business-as-usual case."
1,"And when those relationships come to their natural renewal point is when we have the dialogue around how we structured our relationships, and frankly, that has given us an opportunity to take roughly 400 products that are in our specialty portfolio and make sure they're priced in a more discrete way. And as more innovation comes, that platform allows us to continue to price those products in a more refined fashion."
1,"And when we think about items inside the store, we've been doing this for a long time in terms of competitive mindset on an individual market basis with cigarettes, with beer, with packaged, pop, and other beverages, and this really kind of brings it all centralized, brings it in-house. Again, so we can provide that data collection and information that will allow us to make better decisions to not only drive sales opportunities but profit opportunities so we can find the balance. And we'll do a lot of testing in the beginning to make sure that we find the boundaries here and what works best."
1,"And when you   any of you, if you were to step foot in   many of you have perhaps, in some of Columbus McKinnon factories, we can show you good examples that we are in that journey, but we have failed to benchmark ourselves really well to world class. And when we take that approach, we think there's a significant opportunity in our factories to do. I'm going to give you a good example."
1,"And whether that's around transforming the workforce or creating a simply irresistible organization, we think that Cornerstone's platform is really part of that solution. So, for us, aside from sort of getting an incremental piece of that $100 million, we do think there are some significant opportunities to drive sort of adjacent services in many of the areas where we play that are very complementary to Cornerstone's suite, things like employee experience, things like analytics, things like learning an HR transformation. Josh mentioned earlier, sort of forensic spend analysis, right?"
1,"And while we also have publishers, you're right, we have a lot of advertisers as well. So, building out an opportunity that allows us to scale on top of our framework becomes a very attractive one for us to build up on. You see, in that, we believe that if we build out a business which is going to service a client, more like a media servicing agency, it may generate profits for us, but it will be very hard to scale."
1,"And with that it's hard to be able to predict that in a short timeframe as to what that would look like. Based on what we see in our pipeline and our forecasts and our opportunities and our engagements with our customers in the markets, we feel confident about our confirming of the guidance, and we will update you as we proceed forward."
1,"And with this belief in mind, we will continue the process to obtain the Presidential Permit we initiated in 2017. Our use of a subsea cable allows us to bring power directly to Plymouth, Massachusetts, site of the soon to be retired Pilgrim nuclear plant, bringing power directly to the Boston load center, while avoiding congestion in New England without the need for new terrestrial transmission lines. Over the long-term, we believe our proposed Atlantic Link Project can help meet the state's and the region's need for clean energy in a very cost effective manner, and we continue to explore opportunities to advance the project."
1,"And yes, we have been somewhat constrained by how we bring these wells online. But we have worked with Williams extensively to put together what we think is a world-class gathering system and header system out there that gives us the optionality and also allows us to reduce pressures in different parts of the field and move gas around when need be, to take advantage of any disconnect in the market. So I think we'll see things once we are able to take advantage more proactively of a more versatile market."
1,"And you go into those branches and watch in terms of what's changed from the reduction in the teller lines and the interaction out in front in terms of some of the machines, 1,600 ATMs with more or increased functionality being put in place. And then when you look at digital, actually when we look year-over-year, we've got an increase of 38% of digital engagement in Mexico, above our expectations, and that allows us to continue to drive out costs. So you look at Mexico, yes, we got 6% revenue growth, but we did that inclusive of investment with 4% expense growth."
1,And you've seen that as we've expanded from paper-based products into personalized gifts and home dÃ©cor. So we feel confident in the ability to do that in both new categories. We also think that the margin profiles will be consistent with what you've seen in the past out of Shutterfly.
1,"And, again, that represents a very diverse cross section across all of our areas. And clearly, when we see a gap in our portfolio that's not meeting customer needs, and a good example of that is over the past several years in trauma with the extremity area, or where we see new technology such as stroke that allows us to address an area where there's a lot of unmet medical need and a great new approach. So, yeah, we're constantly looking across all those different platforms."
1,"ANGPTL3 is an upstream target that we're targeting to impact downstream modulation of a number of lipids in a number of indications. Antisense is an elegant way to target ANGPTL3, because as we've seen in our Phase 1 study, it allows us to knock down this key modulator with great specificity and results in a consistent response. As a reminder, in the ANGPTL3-LRx Phase 1 study, clinical results substantial dose dependent reductions in multiple lipids and lipoproteins including triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, APO(b), non-HDL cholesterol and APOCIII."
1,"Another goal for 2018 is to engage with our regional stakeholders on smart community initiatives, including the possible clarification of the law in Texas during the 2019 legislative session regarding deployment of Advanced Metering Infrastructure in our service territory. This will allow us to take advantage of technology to enhance grid resiliency and operations. It will also allow the company to provide expanded customer services such as smart pricing options, high usage alerts, and online energy management."
1,"Another highlight this year was our announcement of the pending acquisition of AdCare. This presents a significant opportunity for us to diversify our payer mix, particularly in government pay and to grow our presence in New England. The AdCare facilities being acquired include 114-bed hospital for substance abuse treatment, and five outpatient centers in Massachusetts; and a 52 bed residential treatment center and two outpatient centers in Rhode Island."
1,"Another notable achievement during the quarter was the acquisition of Etratech which significantly expands our capabilities in advanced electronic controls and control systems. With the acquisition of Etratech and expansion of our electronic product capabilities, we're creating integrated intelligent solutions that will allow us to increase our value content, as well as extending into other automotive applications. In addition, we're working on a number of very exciting opportunities which I look forward to reporting back to you over the next few quarters."
1,"Another opportunity for pharmacy is to further expand our clinical service offerings. While we have strong momentum with flu immunization, we have a significant opportunity to further increase adult non-flu immunizations that protect against conditions like shingles, pneumonia and whooping cough. We're also highly focused on working with patients to improve medication adherence."
1,"approval expected in 2019 for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The addition of fedratinib to our portfolio will allow us to build a leadership position in myelofibrosis, and we are actively preparing for a mid-year FDA submission. With our early pipeline, we are advancing our newest CELMoD, CC-92480, with a phase I trial initiated in relapsed/refractory myeloma."
1,"Approximately 20% of our company-owned growth of five to six locations will be on the East Coast and about 50% of our total development will be drive-thru locations. Looking to 2019, we expect a company-operated new store growth rate of around 10% which will allow us to continue to focus on the initiatives I laid out. In addition, as we continue to pivot to more drive-thrus, we would expect the majority of our new locations in 2019 to be drive-thrus."
1,"Aritzia is a vertically integrated fashion brand. First, we have a differentiated global sourcing strategy that allows us to continually refine our supply chain to elevate our product whilst increasing the value to our customers. Second, we have innovative and creative strategies that ensure we provide a balanced assortment of beautiful, high quality products that our customer desires."
1,"As a combined company, we can serve our customers across all of the key milestones in the life of a family, helping them commemorate important moments starting at birth, then throughout the school years from preschool to graduation and onto marriage and holidays. Second, we believe that a continued focus on delivering customer facing innovation and improving our products and services will allow us to continue to drive profitable growth going forward. Finally, we believe the greater scale enables us to better serve our customers and to drive better financial results for our investors through our shared manufacturing platform, through common technology platform and through a large customer base."
1,"As a leading provider of applied additive manufacturing solutions, we are now increasing our investments to accelerate several internally-incubated projects that, we believe, have significant potential to expand our addressable markets. We view the potential for FDM-based conformal printing platforms and composite materials used in additive manufacturing platforms as a long-term significant opportunity and believe that additive manufacturing systems that offer greater printer control and later, for a platform for composite and hybrid process manufacturing, will play a critical role in the aerospace and automotive industries. In late 2016, we unveiled the Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator, an early iteration of next-generation, high-end, FDM-based printing for manufacturing."
1,"As a market leader, that's what we have to do, right, so stay focused on our core strategy which is really grow the market really from OTC into LINZESS, and also how do we continue to raise the bar with regard to the clinical performance of our drug. The first is going to be the addition of the abdominal symptoms claim, which we believe will allow us to speak to a broader patient population to drive a new source of business. In addition, the delayed release program will expand the clinical utility drug beyond just IBS and chronic constipation into other forms of IBS as far as its ability to relieve abdominal pain and additional abdominal symptoms."
1,"As a matter of fact, we should get synergies out of driving   looking at that across units. And for example, as we look at our new segment now with Presort and Global Ecommerce and Newgistics all combined, that allows us to go to market in a more consistent dynamic. And that should help us significantly in that approach."
1,"As a reminder, our operating agreement with PayPal remains in place until mid-2020, and our ability to offset the expense related to this investment is limited until the expiration of the existing agreement. We look forward to working with Adyen as our new partner and with PayPal in a new capacity to deliver on this significant opportunity. Moving to full year guidance on slide 15, we are projecting 2018 revenue between $10."
1,"As a reminder, there are hundreds of thousands of buildings within 500 feet of our network. Domestically and internationally, we have relatively low market share, and we believe we have significant opportunity to drive revenue growth over time. The key to our success is ensuring we have the appropriate relationship with each customer."
1,"As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we have the option to repatriate OUS cash with minimal tax impact. We have significant opportunity for growth outside of the U. S."
1,"As a result of these new introductions, approximately half of the segment's cardio product sales in 2018 will result from products refreshed in either 2017 or 2018. The offering of console capabilities on a greater range of product, allows us to better address the club's changing console needs. Both exercisers and club operators are looking for cardio equipment with greater capabilities, enabled by today's technology."
1,"As a result, we continue to see very senior sales reps outperform and this drives our belief that we have the opportunity to continue to improve sales productivity. We believe that the market share that remains for us to capture is substantial and are building a sales organization that will allow us to leverage this opportunity. To sum up, 2017 was an excellent year for Paycom and we are excited about continuing our momentum through 2018."
1,"As a result, we could see levered returns in Agency MBS become more attractive on a standalone and relative basis, serving to absorb a portion of the anticipated increase in net MBS supply. Maintaining moderate levels of leverage will allow us to be opportunistic, if and when the opportunity arises. This concludes our prepared remarks."
1,"As a result, we paused enrollment to implement various design enhancements to the Caisson system based on our clinical learnings and physician feedback from the patients treated to-date. In addition, we have continued development of two larger valve sizes which will allow us to significantly expand the population of treatable patients. All of this was submitted to the FDA last week which we believe will create a three-month delay in our timelines."
1,"As a trusted advisor with world class product capability, we can better support our customers' initiatives and help them drive long-term business successes, even as we increase the adoption of ANSYS products and solutions. This allows us to convert a small footprint into a large ongoing relationship. That strategy is continuing to gain momentum with large companies around the world."

This allows us to convert a small footprint into a large ongoing relationship. That strategy is continuing to gain momentum with large companies around the world."
1,"As a value investor, my investment in Emergent Capital was predicated on the underlying fundamentals as a company. However, it was the operational flexibility that I saw going forward and the significant opportunity to layer growth initiatives on top of Emergent's core assets that drove me to take on the role of CEO in October. Today, Emergent stands positioned to realize the long-term gains which are embedded in the assets we own."
1,"As always, we continuously consider options to balance our goals of maximizing long-term equity returns with delivering upfront cash flow, while minimizing our exposure to changes in base interest rates. Based on the increasing acceptance of the residential solar asset class and overall strong market conditions, we see opportunity to reduce our capital costs in 2018, both on new and existing debt transactions. Across all components of our capital stack, current market conditions support spreads that are 50 basis points to 100 basis points lower than our average 2017 transaction."
1,"As Bob mentioned, international is pacing ahead of our original plans and will continue to be an important engine of growth for Viacom. For the balance of this fiscal year, we see opportunities for enhanced growth in affiliate revenues and expect full year growth to improve to low double digits, given growth in Latin America and our extended and expanded India JV licensing agreement. International ad revenues are expected to continue to be strong with growth in the low to mid teens for fiscal 2018."
1,"As companies in this space look to improve quality, speed and accuracy, they see the value in machine vision. This market currently represents about 10% of our revenue, and we see opportunities to grow this by 50% per year over the next number of years. 3D vision is another growth area for Cognex."
1,"As discussed last year, we implemented Sorenson's Spark Analytics tool for second-by-second audience measurement. This year we entered into an agreement that allows us to both sell targeted ads via smart TVs. Because of their addressable nature, such spots typically sell for two times to three times linear CPMs."
1,"As discussed previously, our plan is to partner with a contract sales organization, Publicis and several other best-in-class service providers that we will use to complete preparatory work on the pricing, reimbursement and market access fronts, as well as defining an optimal structure for third-party logistics. This framework will allows us to rapidly drive market uptake and adoption by the end user. And the fourth is driving new product innovation and advancing our orthobiologics and regenerative medicine product candidates through clinical development."
1,"As far as engineering goes in the synergies, it's not been a major area that we've called out. The complementary nature of the products is such that a lot of the application engineering we're doing is for different vehicle architectures, different parts of the drive train, there will certainly be some, but we see more of the significant opportunities around material, the lean manufacturing environment and central costs, because we want remain committed to the R&D spending that's going to be required to keep us ahead of the pack from and electrification now that we've got this great competitive position."
1,"As far as IHM, the amount of cross-polarization that occurred before, so we call this as a collection of businesses in a number of different areas, and we just did not make the link in the past. And we see a significant opportunity for doing so, so we're doing it. I think the key message to take from this is we've had phenomenal performance over the years and we keep finding opportunities, whether it's around commercial growth, around M&A, around productivity, to continue to improve ourselves, and this is just the next step in doing so."
1,"As I mentioned earlier, we're looking forward to leveraging the best of both companies to drive greater growth and value for our shareholders. We see significant opportunity to grow the Blue Buffalo business by leveraging General Mills' deep customer relationships, our category management insights, our supply chain expertise, and innovation skills, among others. At the same time, it is clear that General Mills can benefit from Blue Buffalo's experience building an authentic 21st century brand that resonates with millennials and consumers focused on premium natural products."
1,"As I said at the beginning of the call, I am excited about the opportunity S&W has before it as a unique middle-market agricultural company. We have gone through an extensive, strategic planning process and believe we have laid out a pathway that allows us to maximize our upside, while minimizing our risk profile and ultimately creating shareholder value. Thank you for your continued support."
1,"As I said, the acquisition, I think, of Magnus and Sullom Voe aligns very well with the group. It allows us to reduce costs on a very important terminal following in the footsteps of what BP was doing, and that allows all the fields, including our fields, to have extended life. And then, Kraken, we do see, as I mentioned, some significant upside and some significant opportunities."
1,"As it relates to our financial flexibility, we will continue to invest, where we see accretive growth. So, as we see additional markets, as we see opportunities to spend additional OpEx for marketing, obviously, we'll use that flexibility to generate incremental growth in mid-market and Enterprise."
1,"As mentioned at our Investor Day in December, demand for our Mining Solutions product is very strong, while market supply has tightened. Our Laguna, Mexico expansion will allow us to take advantage of these positive market conditions, as the facility comes online in early 2019. Construction is on track and is expected to be complete by the end of this year."
1,"As mentioned before, we successfully maintain our leadership position in the CRM BPO market in Latin America with a 17% market share, and we estimate we ended with over 11% market share in the Latin America digital market. Moreover, we saw a confirmation of the significant opportunities, we foresee in existing and new clients across our footprint and sectors, with ongoing acceleration in non-TelefÃ³nica telcos in Brazil and Spain, as well as increasing penetration in fast growing verticals like healthcare, retail or consumer electronics. A great example of our expansion into other verticals is our commercial relationship with Samsung in Brazil."
1,"As Mr. Huang mentioned, our strong relationship allows us to leverage Xiaomi's established foothold in many of these markets which will aid our entry with affordable wearables. 2017 was a great year for Huami."
1,"As Nick will reference when we go through the 2018 annual guidance. Overall, we feel confident that we are well-positioned going into 2018 to provide best-in-class customer service and achieve our growth targets. Capital spending on the ended on the low side of our guidance range, with some projects deferred into 2018, which explains a portion of the expected increase included in our guidance for the new year."
1,"As our portfolio is amortizing, we're really looking to continue to drive operating efficiency in that space. And we also believe on some of our business processing areas, there's significant opportunities for us to take advantage of many of the same things we have done in student loan servicing related to automation and data analytics that are starting to take hold there. In Earnest, we are looking for   we believe we can generate net interest margins in the 2% range in that space, and given the excellent credit performance on refi loans that these loans will generate returns on equity in the mid-to-high teens."
1,"As part of our new go-to-market strategy, we are moving in the United States from a generalist sales team to more specialized roles to better target our customers. Territories that were once defined by geography are now defined by accounts, which we believe has greater market potential and allows us to serve our best customers even better. We've also made substantive changes to our partner program, including increased focus on our most strategic partners, changes in incentives to align with our mutual outcomes, and an increased focus on the cloud platforms, such as AWS, Azure and Google."
1,"As promised, the acquisition has been immediately accretive to earnings and has generated significant cash flow to repay our debt. This will allow us to evaluate our next major strategy moves to grow the company and drive value for our shareholders. We continue to see both top and bottom line growth resulting from strength in our end markets, along with market share gains and new program launches."
1,"As Rajiv outlined, I am encouraged by our commitment to reinvest in our business, especially in the areas of sales and marketing. Doing so will allow us to keep leveraging our global commercial platform. In addition, it will ensure commercial readiness as we launch Glatiramer in additional markets around the world and boost conversion rates as we introduce our other key products such as pegfilgrastim and generic Advair and as we expand our global key brands."
1,"As Steve and Bill mentioned earlier, we are pleased about our latest transaction with Censa. This type of structure with an upfront consideration and option to acquire the asset after key milestones are reached is very attractive, as it allows us to materially de-risk the program before committing additional financial and human capital. We continue to be active and looking for both clinical and commercial assets that can add value to our organization."
1,"As that happens, the platform in the content becomes inextricably linked and you'll see this across various sectors, but it is most definitely true in the sectors that Wiley plays in, research and learning, et cetera. And so, having a flexible extensible platform and a first class development team, I mean world class development team in Atypon allows us to be at the leading edge of that or the benefit of our researchers, our authors, our societies, our librarians and our various partners and ourselves as a publisher. Then there are the   well, your question was market facing and so I will leave it there, because that answers the question I believe."
1,"As Todd said, with two-thirds of the market, there will be a long list of approved indications that we won't get to for some period of time with RT002. And if we're successful with this by biosimilar approach allows us to accelerate greater participation in those areas that we're not going to get to right away with RT002. Todd, do you want to sort of add to that?"
1,"As Ware commented, we expect our effective federal tax rate to be reduced from 35% to approximately 25%. A portion of the savings from the lower rate will allow us to accelerate certain investments to enhance the growth of the business. For example, we are planning to increase the number of new producers being hired, trained and supported in our Benefits and Insurance group which will allow us to increase the rate of organic revenue growth in that group."
1,"As we are already operating within our target net leverage range, we intend to use approximately $7 billion of our cash that's held overseas to repay gross debt. Now, this will allow us to reduce the spread between our gross and net debt levels, support our credit rating and continue to access the commercial paper market and reduce our net interest expense. We believe this framework provides the right balance between maintaining financial flexibility and what we believe to be our optimal capital structure."
1,"As we communicated recently in our published investor decks, we expect to provide customer samples by the end of 2018, and plan to subsequently ramp production in 2019. We believe this higher-density component will allow us to expand into new applications, while also bringing lower cost per bit benefits to our customers. As to our embedded MRAM activities, our joint technology development with GLOBALFOUNDRIES continues to progress."
1,"As we continue to grow, there will be exciting opportunities for our employees. So, in conclusion, this is a unique strategic combination which allows us to create a global leader in vehicle drive systems and electric propulsion. We will achieve this through the four elements of our strategy, namely through the scaling of the portfolio by leading the market for electrification, the completion of our global platform, and the delivery of value for our shareholders and our customers."
1,"As we enter fiscal 2019, our strong pipeline gives us confidence in our continued growth story. We see significant opportunity across product segments and geographies, with financial management and business outside the U. S."
1,"As we get further into some of these new initiatives, we'll try to provide some additional guidance on how quickly things will ramp. But again, especially with the credit initiatives, we're really looking at that as being a significant opportunity for increased earnings in 2019 more so than in 2018 between the startup costs and the upfront provisioning."
1,"As we get into Q2, it will start to be contributing on a more steady and regular basis. And then as the year goes on, we'll continue to add capabilities to that facility that will allow us to further repatriate volume as we go forward. But as you think about Q1, I do think you will see that dynamic in our underlying results on margin, although as Craig pointed out, we do expect a more steady delivery of EPS to kind of counter."
1,"As we head into 2018, we will continue to enhance our customer interaction processes in care and technical support and expose those enhancements to all customer interface channels. We expect this will allow us to further improve our cost structure and provide a better customer experience for our existing customers. We implemented a range of initiatives on the Pega platform that together have improved the customer experience, improved customer care, increased retention and continued to drive higher customer acquisition, all while reducing marketing expense."
1,"As we integrate these businesses, we expect this transaction to be highly synergistic and drive full run rate accretion above 30%, reflecting synergies estimated at $80 million to $100 million. In addition with our anticipated synergies, we will benefit from incremental annual leverage free cash flow in excess of a $100 million which will allow us to rapidly delever to a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 3 times by the end of the third full year of ownership. In addition, in line with our capital allocation strategy, we expect to maintain a meaningful dividend."
1,"As we look ahead to an exciting catalyst-rich 2018, we are laser-focused on executing across all our clinical and corporate objectives and building on the momentum we've created. We believe there is significant opportunity for Karyopharm, and we will continue working to advance selinexor as a potential new treatment paradigm for patients suffering with myeloma, DLBCL, liposarcoma and other malignancies. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."
1,"As we look at that, the next priority is to grow the earnings and growth is the best way for us to drive those earnings. That will allow us to continue to invest in the R&D and invest in scalable systems, because scale is very important. That's what allows us, enables us to stay differentiated in the market and deliver the parts and services to our customers at unprecedented speeds."
1,"As we look at the market now and we see activity levels increasing, we see capital coming back, we do believe that there will be some level of opportunity in the NOCs; I mean NOCs really shut things down. We see opportunities in the Middle East, in Latin, we see opportunities offshore, so we do think it's a more active market. But we're not going to sit and predict that we're going to be back to where we were in the next couple years, but we do see a much more stable environment and an ability to deliver to the mid-single-digit sales growth level in 2018."
1,"As we look into 2019 and from a hedging opportunity perspective, as the condensate grows, that hedge opportunity certainly is there and we can afford to take a slightly lower gas price than we have in the past just because of the significance contribution of the condensate. We're very optimistic that we can maintain a program through the entire year that allows us to be growing. So we only guided through the first half largely because of we've got 21 new wells that we've drilled over the past 15 months."
1,"As we move to a portfolio which is more than two-thirds supported by joint ventures, the level of normal equity return or pure investment in bricks and mortar will basically support the overhead in that business. But that overhead also allows us to invest in joint ventures, and that is the driver for profitability, and the enhanced return on capital in that property business."
1,"As we noted previously, this project is anticipated to generate over $4 million of savings. Equally important to me is it allows us to have more efficiency at the field level as we go through a growth period and the challenges of attracting labor. We also have accelerated the maintenance and make-ready process to prepare the midrange and the GasJack units to meet increasing demands."
1,"As we shared our first shareholder letter, over 85% of clients shared feedback at Fix checkout. This information allows us to be very targeted in the way we improve the client experience. As a recent example of how we use this data to enhance the client experience from the product side, in Q2 we identified a significant opportunity to better serve XXL clients, and in particular XXL clients who's self-identified as husky."
1,"As we think about the business going forward, given access to midstream capital through OMP, we will continue to direct E&P capital to the E&P business, which drives the 15% to 20% growth over the coming years. Just as importantly, OMP has significant opportunities in front of them. OMP is one of few midstream providers out in front of the Williston Basin growth and is in great position to not only support Oasis' growth, but also third-party operators in the basin."
1,"As we've indicated on prior calls, we'll begin to ramp our ad business in 2018. We expect a minor positive profit contribution weighted towards the back half of the year as we continue to roll out additional video ad products, methodically develop capabilities and infrastructure and build the business for the significant opportunity that we see over the long-term. Now turning to the numbers for guidance."
1,"As we've previously indicated, we believe the further development of VK5211 for hip fracture may be most effectively executed by a partner, particularly one with an existing bone or musculoskeletal franchise. To this end, we continue to explore opportunities that will allow us to create further value with the program, and we will provide updates as appropriate. I'll now review recent progress with our second clinical program, VK2809, which is in a Phase 2 study enrolling patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hypercholesterolemia."
1,"As we've stated previously, we're confident in our ability to grow earnings and cash flow long-term, and that our attractive business portfolio, combined with the more efficient operating structure, will produce more diversified and predictable earnings. This will allow us to continue to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders over the long-term. I'll now turn the call over to Richard to review our fourth quarter 2017 results and our 2018 outlook in greater detail."
1,"As with our world headquarters and our innovation center that is under construction, we intend to construct a LEED-certified corporate office building. England has been an excellent performer over the years with consistent increases in sales and profitability, increasing their capacity at the New Tazewell facility will allow us to answer existing demand and continue to expand the England business. Now let's discuss casegoods."
1,"As you can see, 2018, 2019, even to 2020, we don't have any major repayments to do, so to speak, with repayments comes only through 2021 which will be also hopefully refinanced in due course. But that maturity profile comfortably allows us to generate free cash flow to   and to comfortably proceed with any further potential investment decisions. Net debt remains below 2 times adjusted EBITDA."
1,"As you can see, we're well-positioned to continue to deliver strong margins and returns. The solid cash flow generation, expected from the business, provides us with financial flexibility and allows us to continue to reduce debt, return wealth to shareholders in the form of dividends, and make prudent investments in the business, that the business has organic growth opportunities including the Haile expansion and the extension of the mine life of Waihi. There is a real and significant disconnect with our share price today and where it should be."
1,"As you will recall, Unity is an important initiative in making RealPage easy to do business with. It allows us to share data across all applications, provide a single sign on and user authentication, deliver consistent user experience across all of our solutions, build a vast library of shared services that all applications use, and build the technical framework that will enable us to add new clients and future acquisitions seamlessly. Certain components of Unity have already been implemented, resulting in improved integration processes and the achievement of financial synergies, which Bryan will speak about in a moment."
1,"As you've seen, financial strength is across the Teekay Group and in fact is one of our strategic initiatives. This allows us to de-lever the parent balance sheet and increase our liquidity, which is over $500 million now. And it does give us a lot of financial flexibility and a lot more options to address our liability management going forward, and as you mentioned the 2020 bonds."
1,"Asia is still a market where we're entering into. We think there are significant opportunities and we're going to grow that business. But having said that, we still expect to at least break even in our Asian business in FY 2019, and we expect to see significant traction at both the TTV and bookings level, and we'll see an improvement in margin in FY 2019 contributing to at least a breakeven position in our Asian business."
1,"At Airline Solutions, we refined both our product and customer engagement strategies and customers are responding positively. We completed our review of the Airline Solutions product portfolio, and after taking a closer look, have found there's a strategic value associated with having a wide breadth of mission-critical solutions as well as significant opportunities to increase the return on invested capital at many of those solutions. Upgrading customers to the latest version of our products is something that's very important."
1,"At the midpoint of our 2018 scenarios, adjusted cash flow from operations is $90 million and capital expenditures are $8 million to $9 million. Our financial strength allows us to invest in businesses that should benefit from macroeconomic trends in our addressable markets, where we can leverage our core competencies and competitive advantages. In 2018, we have budgeted for approximately $40 million in investments to build out our services and technology offerings, the majority of which is related to our Consumer Real Estate and Origination Solutions businesses."
1,"At the outset of the acquisition of Hospira, we believed that we had lost a substantial amount of contracted business and significant production volume in a fixed cost manufacturing environment. The recent events, combined with a logical integrated value proposition, have enabled us to improve the amount of business we have under long-term contract and will allow us to fill up the factory we acquired in Austin with more volume. This continues into 2019 and 2020, as we heavily invest to increase our own capacity, which can give us the option to move away from Pfizer, Rocky Mount if market conditions change or add more capacity if the need arises."
1,"At the same time, we continue to serve our B2C customers by offering a broad selection of styles, with a strong focus on functional footwear through our individual branded websites. The continued development of our B2C strategy will allow us to further strengthen our consumer connections, while complementing the growth in our B2C CustomFit model. Finally, military; on top of being up against the tough comparison after last year's record results, the business faces some additional headwinds in 2018."
1,"At the same time, we will spend $5 million on a new Timok brownfield exploration program. This will allow us to build on the promising exploration results announced last month, the discovery of a new high grade copper gold mineralization 500 meters east of the Timok Upper Zone. This spend is further supported by the knowledge that at the Bor deposits only five kilometers to the north of Timok, approximately a 144 million tonnes of massive sulfide mineralization was mined from 27 separate ore bodies."
1,"At this point, it isn't clear what the time line will be, nor is it clear what the outcome will be. But in the meantime, we will continue to build a flexible lending platform that will allow us to adapt our products to a final rule. We believe that our focus on products, with the features customers want and our flexible online model, are preferred by borrowers and it will enable us to grow our share of the non-prime credit market."
1,"At this point, the lift in shift, if you will, is largely complete and we are now in stabilization mode. This new capability will allow us to turn our attention towards standardizing, automating and transforming our mid- and back-office functions and continuing to get constant ongoing productivity. Number 8."
1,"Based on existing design wins and opportunities in the pipeline, this is a business that could grow from less than $1 million to over $100 million in annual sales within the next three to five years. Cree Venture, our JV with San'an, allows us to address the larger mid power LED market with no CapEx, low OpEx while allowing us to focus our internal development resources on developing more differentiated LEDs for specialized markets. For our Lighting business, the past year has been about fixing problems and supporting customers."
1,"Based on my learnings and the evolving retail environment, an important focus during the last few months has been developing an omni-channel strategy and roadmap for Sportsman's Warehouse. As the lines between brick and mortar and e-commerce channels continue to blur further across retail, we have a significant opportunity to strengthen existing relationships and forge new ones with customers through an improved omni-channel experience. Given our omni-channel focus, we believe it makes sense to view same-store sales holistically as opposed to a separate by channel."
1,"Based on our success, and with a view to gaining greater visibility into new technologies with the greatest potential, we recently launched a first of its kind commercial real estate technology accelerator in partnership with one of the leading technology investors, and an experienced accelerator host. The new Colliers Proptech Accelerator powered by Techstars will allow us to source, shape and invest in new technology solutions that meet our criteria across the entire real estate value chain. So with a strong balance sheet and ample capacity to fund our continued growth, a significant acquisition in Finland at the start of the year, and stable market conditions for the foreseeable future, we are optimistic 2018 will be another year of excellent performance for our company."
1,"Based on the footprint of our current and future service providers, we expect to have delivery in approximately half of our stores by year-end. Lastly, the move to the Olo ordering platform will allow us to accelerate other key initiatives to close the gap on convenience, including a new mobile app and a loyalty program, both of which we expect to launch this year and both of which will help us migrate more orders online. On the relevant side, over the last several months, we completed quite a bit of research on our brand."
1,"Based on the table of production cost that we put out in our press release and MD&A, we expect cash cost of CAD 96 a tonne or CAD 46 per carat. This reflects an increase from 2017, but we do believe that we have significant opportunities to try to come in below those costs. So, with that, I'll turn it back over to David Whittle."
1,"Basically, given that we have been getting a lot of brine because of our collection of products, our plan is that we will not need to pump any additional brine. What we will do is to optimize, increase the deals, we have new ways of doing it that will allow us to produce all the additional lithium that we want to produce without pumping more brine. So in that respect, most of the investments to do the additional lithium that we will be producing will be at the chemical plant site."
1,"Because of our concentrated Northeastern geographic service territory, we can be materially impacted by our client spending priorities. That said, our strong brand position in this territory along with the infrastructure needs that exist across all of North America for substation, transmission and distribution create not only the strategic need, but also significant opportunity for Matrix to grow in other geographic regions. Volumes in this segment compared to previous quarters were also impacted by our strategic shift in power generation away from large EPC projects to smaller work packages where we continue to find success."
1,"Because of our position on the frontlines, we also learned which products are being evaded and how, and what capabilities are needed to detect and stop these attacks. FireEye uses this knowledge to fuel our continuous innovation cycle, and this cycle allows us to adapt sooner and innovate faster, keeping our products relevant and our customers protected. Now let's talk specifically about the innovation in the FireEye platform."
1,Because you might have one Pentair product where you get an opportunity to learn about other Pentair products. So build brand awareness and elevation for us and also allows us to target-market at those potential consumers. So imagine you're in Arizona and you have a pool.
1,"Before I explain the enhanced prospects of the combined company, I'll provide some background on what the joint venture structure looks like today and why we firmly believe that this is the best path forward for Xerox. Moving to slide 11, while the Fuji Xerox joint venture has certainly been among the longest lasting and most fruitful partnership in the history of the technology industry, there are significant opportunities to improve the operational and financial aspects of the relationship. The transaction creates a combined company that will be dramatically stronger and more competitive than either company is on a standalone basis."
1,"Beyond our core homebuilding operations, our joint venture and financing divisions have each surpassed our expectations, contributing pre-tax income in excess of $13 billion during 2017, and meaningful returns on investment. The performance of our joint venture partnership with Wade Jurney Homes has been extremely positive and allows us to further benefit from the increasing demand from first-time buyers to a high-returning asset-light model. Since the inception of the joint venture in November 2016, our share of income from the venture has reached over $12 million, more than validating our initial investment of $18 million."
1,"Beyond the cost guidance of 2018 and 2019, we do foresee the higher investment level to broadly be maintained. And investments into the areas mentioned by Birgitte will allow us to offset underlying cost inflation and, over time, lead to net cost reductions. Our market-leading cost efficiency will continue to be a key competitive factor for the foreseeable future and be a core component supporting us in our 15% return on equity target."
1,"Bluegreen has a flexible model with a balanced mix of developed and capital-light inventory. Working with our third-party developers allows us to generate fees from selling and marketing their VOIs, which averaged a 69% commission in 2017 compared to 68% in 2016 without incurring the upfront capital investments generally associated with resort acquisitions and development. We believe we are well positioned in a fast-growing market and have a unique opportunity in our industry with a differentiated target customer base and multiple sales channels through strategic relationships to reach new owner leads."
1,"Both Crem and Welbilt will benefit from access to the other's customers as there is very little overlap. Operationally, we see opportunities to leverage each company's strengths in digital technologies, systems, user interfaces as well as bring Welbilt's new product introduction process and the Welbilt production system to Crem. Further, Crem has a very strong and energetic management team in place to drive these growth and operational improvements."
1,"Both our own existing clients as well as Interoute's clients has been very strong. And, we think, there are significant opportunity for us to be much more aggressive as we continue to grow our business, which is why we said in our prepared remarks that we put another marker out there to grow our sales force to 250 pre-Interoute by the end of this year. We think our   we're an outstanding place for the great talent in our industry to come to, and we see great opportunity to continue to penetrate in the market."
1,"Broadly speaking, Axon is at a new juncture. We have a platform of innovative and interconnected businesses that will allow us to continue creating and dominating new markets. You've heard our perspective and the path we're taking at our November Analyst Day."
1,"BT, EE and Plusnet. And I think that, in itself, as you navigate the change in market conditions or as we navigate that change, really allows us to I think set ourselves up well to grow across multiple market segments. So, yes, it is   some of these trends and some of these headwinds are a little fierce at the moment, but I'm confident as a business, we'll be able to navigate our way through it and, at the same time, transform our cost base to ensure that we're able to take full advantage of the digital transformation opportunities that I think exist across our own operating model as well as those that our customers are going through."
1,"Bureau van Dijk fits beautifully into this product strategy. The addition of the BvD business to our portfolio will allow us to pursue this repackaging and repurposing approach even more extensively. BvD's expansive, well-curated and very unique set of information is the foundation for a very large and successful business in its own right."
1,"But also what it means is, for example, we were able to take a slightly different view on our insurances, contract works, public liability insurances where we have the surety of our principal controls in this area. So we can reassess our insurance covers, which allows us to become more efficient in terms of covering that risk forward. So that also provides, if you translate that into pounds per plot legally completed, that could   maybe Â£50 a plot."
1,"But as I said, it's important to remember that there is a lag time, so it will take time to get there. So 2018, I would look back to 2013 where we shipped 6,500 pumps, so we still have significant opportunity from the back half of that year as well as 2014 we shipped 10,800 pumps, so those will start to come into play in 2018. And since we've had that good growth each year, this just provides continued opportunities going forward, every year the renewal opportunity grows for us."
1,"But as we see it now, we're learning from each other. We see opportunities to further improve. We saw an improvement of â‚¬131 million."
1,"But as you look at the remaining segments we have, over 10 of those that we think there's a combination of leverage of introduction of product into one country or another as well as internal growth opportunities in the country that that product is based in that we still haven't realized. One of the key elements as we bring those products, some of those here to Canada, is obviously the Intact distribution network and reputation and relationships and it's us bringing more product to them and so I think that's a real significant opportunity. As well, we've alluded to a number of times some of the new exposure areas that generally lend themselves to focus on specialization, sharing economy, medical technology, cyber, et cetera."
1,"But as you've also heard, this is just the tip of the iceberg. We're just really getting started on what this is going to mean for S&P Global and being able to affiliate ourselves and link up with some of the best minds in finance, some of the best minds in science who will allow us to not just do experimentation and R&D but really, as you can also see from Daniel, there's a there's a practical approach. Our idea is to apply these to the products and the services and the data opportunities that we have and make S&P Global a company that is really going to be driving the future in financial markets and commodity markets."
1,"But at the end of the day, we're focused on saying how do we maximize the return to our security holders? If that means we see opportunities to divest some non-core assets and reinvest that money into high quality assets for the   that will be part of the portfolio at the long term. The answer is we   that is part of our asset recycling and our capital management plan and we expect that to continue."
1,But do you see there's a significant opportunity given the strong flu season? So this...
1,"But equally, whether it will go down a bit, Paul, I think that really depends on the mix of projects because we think it's just   a sensible thing to do to keep basically profit and cash in tandem. And the cost of that money is pretty cheap for us, which allows us to go and do those projects, which is the right thing."
1,"But for the short-term, we are not planning to have any price adjustments. Yes, obviously, we have plans to tackle OpEx and to bring more efficiencies not only in short-term, but long-term and we have this transformation program that will allow us to have significant gains, in terms of agility and efficiency. We are working on that, that's a long-term projects with other objectives namely in improving customer experience and becoming more digital."
1,"But generally, it's timed to a targeted pay cycle. Our new mobile onboarding app allows us to get a client's home team on embedded very quickly even with multiple locations across many states. This allows us to begin to generate revenue from new engagements generally within a couple of weeks."
1,"But I can tell you that in 2018, the things that we're doing is, we're expanding our capabilities. Technologically speaking, we're developing more flow sheets, that's the technical term in the industry, which allows us to valorize more diverse feed into our activities. We are increasing capacity, some of that is by debottlenecking in order to be able to do more and we're optimizing essentially our refining plants in the same process and our commercial folks are looking at more complex feeds to bring in."
1,"But I think auto will be a gradual glide over the medium term, and we frankly use that as a way to drive upside in yields by finding higher risk return opportunities in the education space or in other areas in unsecured. And that allows us to run down the auto book on that kind of path. So that will give you a sense for basically what we expect there."
1,"But I think what we've learned through both the Ibis and the Mantra exercise is that we think this is a really good and strong business opportunity. We think there's a shortfall of up to 1,000 rooms, as I mentioned, on the hotel precinct and we feel confident now building to the type of success we've had at Mantra and Ibis."
1,"But in fact, we do want to make sure we get it right with the number of   with the hirings that we're doing across the sales and marketing organization, and in across the development. And yeah, so we see it, continued investment given the fact that the opportunity still allows us to grow in this area."
1,"But in terms of growth potential for the company, we'll continue to look at terminals as well and if the right terminal package comes up and we think it fits our business model we'll look to expand upon that. But we do look at our assets broadly as integrated, if you will, meaning we like the connectivity between terminaling and supply throughput as well as retail, because it allows us to bring volume to those terminal assets and we think that that's actually a differentiator in terms of value that we can drive for our assets."
1,"But in the meantime, as soon as we get the approval for Sonalleve in China, I do think we will work with Philips already   we already have an agreement, and we will work with them right away to begin to build the revenue line. So I think with that, I think that's sort of the priority at the moment for us, and I think the financial   that the strength that we have now will allow us to really execute to all of that. Anything beyond that I don't think it is something that's we're contemplating in the short term."
1,"But in the quarter, we leveraged selling expenses significantly. We saw a significant opportunity for leverage. And I think that's a testament to the opportunity, the brand to grow in markets that we've already seeded with selling investment."
1,"But investing in Sky Originals brings a number of other benefits to the business. It gives us more security of supply, allows us to strike better deals with rights holders, and it enables us to participate in the growing demand for high-quality content. Now moving on to innovation in our products and services, our aim here is to make the Sky experience better for all customers, providing them with greater value for money but also to make it easier for more people to get Sky on their terms."
1,"But it does benefit the land that we bought of historical densities, and that's where much of those gains have come, I suppose. The fast-track process is positive for us, Colin, because as you evolve, as the market evolves and customer demand evolves across different mixes and types of product, it does allow us to make planning changes quite quickly on existing sites that already have planning and are consented, but it allows us to adapt those. And we've already had a few successful."
1,"But it's obviously a very exciting area, right, and there is lots of innovation but nothing at real scale. We think we are in the box seat because we're now through the re-platforming, we've got that technology that allows us to do the innovation, but more importantly, we've got the foundational pieces to scale the active users, the brands so that if we deploy the right innovation, and hopefully we're giving you confidence that we have clear plans on that going forward, we think we will be leading price comparison innovation and taking it to the next chapter."
1,"But leaning on our partner a little bit in the beginning and hopefully, we'll start being able to take on more of the lion's share of that. But as we see the success, the hospitals are taking on the ownership of it, I think that will allow us to increase the capacity that we're able to provide."
1,"But more importantly, our horsepower management saves our customers' money. We are able to pull off horsepower, to not charge our customer for that horsepower, which, I think, is an advantage and our scale allows us to do that. And a lot of that savings does go to our customer."
1,"But on the next page, you see basically the rationale. And we believe, by teaming up with General Atlantic, we really have not only additional financing but, we believe, accelerated M&A, more operational excellence, better access to talent that allows us to have as well a smarter governance, and a simplified and focused structure. And, again, Jan will give you more insights into the deal in his part."
1,"But on the next page, you see basically the rationale. And, we believe, by teaming up with General Atlantic, we really have not only additional financing but, we believe, accelerated M&A, more operational excellence, better access to talent that allows us to have as well, a smarter governance and a simplified and focused structure. And, again, Jan will give you more insights into the deal in his part."
1,"But on your own cost side, you know, the margins, I appreciate were impacted by acquisition in 2017, but actually, slipped year-on-year. Going forward, do you think there will be a focus and do you see a significant opportunity to reduce the OpEx base within Elisa in 2018? Thank you."
1,"But once again, we are very enthusiastic about some of these deals in the pipeline. The kind of impact of these deals, the complexity of these deals, the fact that they lead with technology transformation, the fact that they need, all the core areas that WNS has been investing in and more importantly the fact that it allows   each of these deals allows us to engage with the senior most stakeholders on the other side. So, very, very positive about the large deal pipeline."
1,"But prioritization, execution, not getting out ahead of ourselves is something we focused on a lot in the last several years to make sure that whatever we produce is the things that the students love, which drive that growth that you saw. And so, yes, we see opportunities to continue to go into high school. Just remind you that between writing and test prep, we are already   in the high schools we're already acquiring those customers earlier and that's helping us as they come into college, get them earlier for both textbooks and for our subscriber businesses."
1,"But rather in Italy, seven and it changes though in Germany, maxed out in single digits. So, players in those spaces will have with   because of the scarcity of licenses and because of the size of the market, significant opportunity to be significant players both in terms of market share and actual P&L and accretive impact."
1,"But that space is not where we're looking really to see revenue growth or a meaningful revenue contribution. What's really exciting for us about having a direct product to consumers is it allows us to innovate and then turn to our customers and say, look at this functionality, don't you need this, wouldn't this make your product better, and then upsell them on that. Really, if you think about whoever the customer is, whether it's Sling, YouTube TV, Sony Vue, we're going to give them either a license to the innovations we have to make their product better or a license to that plus voice search, advanced search, metadata, things that make their product better while still allowing them to completely control that user interface, the branding, the look, the feel."
1,"But the nonexclusive are attractive because they are paid only after a performance is achieved. And so it's a pay for performance model, and it allows us to leverage up against that resource are the ones that we're investing in internally. So it's a nice win-win situation."
1,"But there are other inefficiencies and limitations that come with having two separate product portfolios, R&D roadmaps and supply chains. The combination will allow us to break down these barriers of value creation and align the long-term strategic vision of the two companies. We will also be able to remove duplicative costs in R&D and corporate functions and fully consolidate our supply chain to improve our cost position globally."
1,"But there's more work to be done. Our PPAs provide a significant opportunity in the very near future to reduce costs for our customers even more and fund necessary capital investments across our system at a lower cost. As we lower total costs, we can be more attractive to companies, considering Michigan, for their expansion or relocation."
1,"But there's still excess capacity and it's going to continue to be a grinding market that, like I said, our focus is in Canada, in all of our divisions, but particularly Drilling and Rentals will be cost management. We don't see any significant opportunities to achieve material price increases."
1,But there's still this extensive tax analysis and planning to be done to ensure we execute repatriation in the most efficient manner. This new global mobility of our cash will allow us to continue investing in our businesses in the U. S.
1,"But this isn't enough. While the way mobile consumers are using voicemail is changing, we see opportunity to provide further functionality with CommSuite. This will enable us to capitalize on this evolving market by addressing trends like the growth at BYOD offering new OTT voice mail apps that connect to several different communication channels of choice, dynamic cloud messaging services, in-app direct communications and others."
1,"But through I think tapping into additional states that we'll focus on, probably expanding the portfolio with more adjacencies, intensifying our focus on things like hand wash and liquid washes et cetera, we do see the potential for us to be able to grow faster than the industry. But this is an industry or a category which does grow on a slower pace and so we know that the growth will stabilize over the medium-term, but certainly from our perspective that we feel confident that given our innovations and our go-to-market execution, we should be able to outperform category growth."
1,"But to fully avail ourselves of the opportunities, we had to have a vastly different product portfolio. So through product development and product introductions, as well as strategic acquisitions, in addition to concrete pavers, we now offer value-added hardscapes, masonry products, decorative lawn and garden products, and now a composite decking, which allows us to have a full range of products to satisfy customer needs to execute our strategy within APG, which we call own the backyard. Similarly, looking at a similar-sized business, BuildingEnvelope, in 2007, this business was basically about cutting and shipping to small contractors what we call tempered glass, which is heat-treated glass."
1,"But we are also actively increasing our internal capacity through head count, CapEx and sourcing partners. We believe that our quality, capacity and durability will allow us to have a greater market share in this run-up. Had it not been for the new tax legislation and our deferred asset re-evaluation, this quarter would have been an $0."
1,"But we are also working aggressively to build, to your point, our non-TV impressions. This includes ramping up our social video strategy, particularly through VDS, where we see a significant opportunity to capture share and ad dollars. It also includes continuing to grow Noggin."
1,"But we are today supplying all the battery makers above a local Chinese player with our new Chinese plant, but also the international players which are mostly Japanese and Korean guys. The good news, too, is that we see opportunities to get more out of our current unit in Peru, thanks to manufacturing excellence and the use of some digital tools. So as a whole, very good opportunities in front of us in batteries, but a bit early to quantify what this could represent."
1,"But we are transforming a bit the company at the same time. So we're delivering double-digit EPS growth and double-digit sales growth, while going through a major transformation in the business that will allow us to continue to have sustainable growth. In the future, prestige beauty, in order for us to grow 6% to 8% in constant currency on average, does require investment."
1,"But we do think that this is a good thing for the business. I think it supports journalism, will allow us to better serve our communities with a deeper commitment, and as a result, we're trying to take advantage of this time, and I would certainly expect we'll get some deals done this year, Mike."
1,"But we manage to those numbers very, very well. And of course there is some significant opportunities with every one of the sales reps and then there's some opportunities that we have to always improve within the sales organization and we do that very, very quickly, very rapidly and whenever we need to do it."
1,"But we'd like to see more volume, we'd like to see more investment. We think we have a footprint that will allow us to do more. So we're working carefully to think through those options and hopefully we'll have something to announce next quarter."
1,"But we've been looking at this market for many years and this is the first time we see this combined into a setting like this. And so, coupled with the low manufacturing cost allows us to scale very rapidly and also have the ability to enter into more market segments than the rest of the market. This is a very large market, Tycho."
1,"But we've made very good progress and, frankly, learned quite a lot from the experience in Norway that's informed that process. Online adoption is increasing, as you can see, and we see significant opportunity for further growth, up to 100 stores with 5 openings planned for this year, further improvement in digital and for the first time, we're going to put capital in to run a commissary, because currently, we don't have one in Switzerland. We buy dough from a baker."
1,"But what really makes me excited as the CFO is seeing how a shift in our business is going to generate more attractive returns for our shareholders. As you can see from the diagrams here, there's a significant opportunity to increase the revenue from our content per vehicle as we move from the internal combustion engine to an electrified drivetrain. This is true not only for light vehicles, but also for commercial vehicles."
1,"But what we are taking a close look at are SG&A expenses and cost of products sold. SG&A expenses in our segment level represent significant opportunities for us. I'll talk about that in a bit, but starting first and foremost in the cost of sales area."
1,"But what we're really focused on and that's why we called it Fit For Growth back then, was to be fit, so that we could come out of that and then grow as the markets led us to there . And so, with our capital structure, our process improvements, our focus on Lean and Agile, we believe that our agenda over time will allow us to continue to hit these targets."
1,"But when you overlay the kind of growth you see in most of the markets that we're in Asia and you overlay the kind of operational execution that we're capable of delivering. We see opportunities to make the economics work, not in every case, but in enough cases to make it interesting. So it is difficult to talk about specifics."
1,"But, that being said, they still have a robust solution that is relatively inexpensive and they're a viable competitor. Do we see opportunity there, we do, but we don't really get down to commenting on specific hand-to-hand combat. On the Practice Fusion side, I think Allscripts is executing their strategy, and their strategy is different than ours, their P&L has a different aspect   have different aspects than ours and it's   I see them as bringing in a cloud-based solution and we have a cloud-based solution."
1,"By combining with Fuji Xerox, we are creating a global industry leader, with approximately $18 billion in annual revenue, adding significant scale and reach to our current market leadership. We believe this is the right strategic evolution of our long-term alliance as it will allow us to optimize the current operating structure for greater efficiency and global competitiveness. We are projecting to deliver substantial cost saving for the combined company, totaling at least $1."
1,"By early summer, we will open the 150,000 square foot expansion of our Western Distribution Center outside Dallas, Texas. This will feature state-of-the-art furniture handling processes and equipment that will allow us to better serve and grow our business in that important region. We will reduce double handling of product and excess transfers while allowing for more regional selection and faster delivery to our customers."
1,"By significantly increasing the scale of another factory-built housing company to the public markets, there will be increased investor awareness and enhanced liquidity, resulting in additional value to shareholders. The result of the combination is a business with a strong balance sheet and available liquidity that will allow us to pursue our growth strategy. The pro forma company will close with sufficient cash on hand to cover all outstanding debt, allowing the company to retain financial flexibility."
1,"By the way, we're not saying that that's going to happen. But to Rob's point, if we   when we see opportunities that come up, because again, G&A is marketing, we are planning to invest more on marketing. So, if we delevered in G&A like we did in 2017, it wouldn't absolutely surprise us for 2018."
1,"By this quarter, it's done. And it allows us to go more on the offensive now because quite honestly, I mean, we had to play defense in the first year because we had a large number of accounts that had to be essentially restructured to be commercial."
1,"Can you recall when we had Investor Day, as I mentioned, maintenance CapEx will be between 2 point net   between 2. 5% and lower 3% in general and maybe last year or maybe also this year, more at the upper end in the 3%, lower 3% area, given the fact that, yeah, that we see opportunities in order to, yeah, refresh some of our estates which is important investment for the future. So it's not significantly up, it's a tiny bit up."
1,"Cash flow from operations is expected to be $290 million next year, as a result of bringing together two companies that both have strong cash flows. The cash generation profile of the combined businesses, plus the incremental synergies we expect to generate as a result of the transaction, will allow us to generate approximately $200 million of free cash flow after investing in CapEx, of which we expect to devote $170 million to the repayment of debt for the 2018 fiscal year. Given all these factors, we're introducing adjusted full year EPS guidance range of between $3."
1,"Cerro Negro had another strong quarter driven by higher productivity in alignment with our ramp-up and productivity improvement plan. Marianas Norte development work continues as planned and we expect to begin production mining during the second half of 2018, which will allow us to complete to ramp up to 4,000 tonnes per day. At PeÃ±asquito, we experienced better production than anticipated, mostly due to higher than planned grade as we continued mining in Phase 5D."
1,"Certainly, the share buyback, the opportunistic share buyback, as well as what we've done from a CapEx perspective in an asset-light model, we can talk about many things the Bruce mentioned, outsourcing our largest manufacturing facility, Greg mentioned facilities and the move out of Schaumburg to Chicago. So this idea of asset-light allows us to redeploy and dedicate that CapEx to a success-based CapEx. So we've done that."
1,"Certainly. So, it starts with the customer and aligning our investments with the customers' technology roadmap and their strategies that will allow us to grow faster than the market. That leverage that we gain on the top line should allow us to leverage the infrastructure in our facilities as we put more volume through our plants."
1,"Chuck will identify in his comments that the 2018 transition launch plan for full-size trucks is a headwind for this year, and just for this year. We have taken a number of steps to mitigate the magnitude of that headwind quite significantly, including deploying, what we call, a shuttle at Oshawa which allows us to build current generation of truck bodies in Fort Wayne to ship them to Oshawa for final assembly. And that would give us about 60,000 units of incremental volume to help manage through the transition."
1,"Clearly, for the long term, by owning these assets, we are a stronger, better positioned and more competitive pigment producer across the cycle in what is a global market with strong global competitors, including the Chinese producers. Owning these assets allows us to more fully meet the demands of our global customer base to enhance our vertical integration strategy and enhance our competitiveness globally. We have our focus clearly on the significant value drivers of this transaction."
1,"Clearly, the big distribution   the big retail markets are very neatly placed for that, so Russia and Australia. But even with our Distribution markets, we see opportunities as well."
1,"Clients are able to add as many of the incremental items of their choice to any Fix they order. This capability allows us to better serve our clients by being able to serve even more of their wardrobe needs while driving incremental revenue and margin per order. While both of these initiatives are in their early days, we're very excited about the new technological and operational capabilities they offer for our business to further personalize the client experience."
1,"Collectively, they will help us drive our offer, ensuring that our existing luxury brands continue to evolve and allowing us to rejuvenate any new brands that we acquire in the future. On that point, we are currently looking to acquire one or two small luxury asset-light brands that we would incubate and grow in order to access these significant opportunities. avid hotels is our new mid-scale brand, which we launched in September last year."
1,"Collectively, they will help us drive our offer, ensuring that our existing luxury brands continue to evolve and allowing us to rejuvenate any new brands that we acquire in the future. On that point, we are currently looking to acquire one or two small luxury asset-light brands that we would incubate and grow in order to access these significant opportunities. Earlier, I mentioned the launch of avid hotels, which is the most recent addition to our brand portfolio."
1,"com platform, regardless if a dealership has a website with the firm. Specifically, their digital retailing tools will allow us to help provide Cars. com shoppers the ability to transact online, the Conversations platform, which will allow us deep integrations into the Facebook marketplace, which will be unique to Cars."
1,"com. This platform will allow us to utilize our scale through national advertising and have the ability to disseminate driver leads to the most appropriate operating division or location. Furthermore, we are in the process of a full consolidation and integration of two companies purchased during the second half of 2017 that are focused on the highly specific niche."
1,"Combined with more than $2. 8 billion remaining from the previous authorization, we have a significant opportunity to increase shareholder value through buybacks. We plan to be opportunistic, repurchasing more shares when we believe they are significantly undervalued."
1,"commercial launch of the Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect, a liquid biopsy test to help physicians select the most effective treatment for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer that will be sold by both our Oncology and Urology sales forces. And we have a significant opportunity to reduce unnecessary biopsies and spending in the pre-diagnosis stage through our IsoPSA collaboration with Cleveland Diagnostics that Fred will talk about further. We are confident the changes we are implementing to deliver near-term growth and increased profitability will firmly set us on the path to maximize profitable growth and shareholder value, while continuing to pursue a mission defined 18 years ago, to develop and deliver high-value tests that improve treatment decisions and outcomes for cancer patients around the world."
1,"Compared to our peers, we're performing reasonably well. Nonetheless, there is significant opportunity. And in 2018, we're going to start moving towards our target of reducing working capital by $18 million by the end of 2020."
1,"Concourse shops can be easily relocated, giving us higher flexibility to effectively react to the changing mall environments from a real estate management perspective. Notably, guest satisfaction at concourse shops is on par with traditional stores, allowing us to continue to deliver those one-on-one consumer interactions that build the emotional connection that allows us to build and leverage our brand equity. Consistent with our expectations, on average, we continue to see our updated Discovery store format outperform Heritage stores on a comp sales basis and tourist locations exceed traditional mall stores on multiple key metrics, including sales and profit."
1,"Connecting the scientists on this very, very specialized product, how can we alter our formulas, alter what the facilities are actually producing and converting, can we do it here with a different process. So on the Operational Excellence side, linking those two tighter, I think we have some significant opportunities. Then also on the supply chain side connecting how we buy it, how we convert it, and then it's how we sell it."
1,"Consistent with our previously committed medium- to long-term outlook, we expect sales growth of 5% to 7%, aided by a modest uptick in volume, AUV improvement in Mineral Fiber and continued double-digit sales gains in Architectural Specialties. We expect that this level of sales growth will allow us to drive double-digit adjusted improvements as the sales gains, productivity improvements in our plants and the impact of our announced restructuring activities fall to the bottom line. Tax reform will reduce our tax rate from 35% to 25%, and provides a significant boost to our EPS and cash flow."
1,"Consistent with the rest of our industry, tax reform is expected to lower our cash flows from operations due to lower customer bills. As a result of the lower cash flows from operations, we expect to issue a mix of additional debt and equity in the future that allows us to maintain the capital structures authorized for IPL and WPL and their most recent rate reviews. The timing of these future financings will be dependent on future regulatory decisions on tax reform benefit."
1,Consummation of this deal will secure non-dilutive financing to support the launches of both of our late-stage product candidates. We believe our strong balance sheet and financial position allows us to continue to advance both of our late-stage product candidates towards commercialization and that the company has sufficient access to capital to support the launches of both of our products. Let me turn the call over to Sebastian for a clinical and development update.
1,"Continuing to build the next-generation of medical review, we're currently working on the third full implementation of our proprietary medical bill review software. It has been our consistent experience over the past 25-plus years that being on current state-of-the-art technology allows us to not only leverage the latest technological innovations such as machine learning, but also affords us the ability to attract and retain the best information technology talent. Ongoing improvements to our claims intake and return-to-work processes, we continue to evolve our claims system so that we are able to engage the appropriate expertise throughout the claim continuum, ensuring the optimal opportunity for a positive outcome."
1,"corporate tax rate and shift to a territorial tax system will be beneficial to our long-term profitability by lowering our overall tax bill. In addition, it provides us with the flexibility to choose where we invest excess capital, which allows us to make the best investment decisions for shareholders amongst competing opportunities no matter where they are in the world. We welcome the opportunity to invest here in the United States and drive future growth for the company."
1,"Correct. So if we are able to raise the SP   if we are able to raise the NCD at the Trust level, it allows pooling of cash flows and therefore giving a better stability to rating agencies and investors of bond, which in turn will allow us to reduce our cost of debt in a simpler structure. In addition to that, it also provides tax efficiency, because we'll be able to invest this capital in the subsidiary as a loan and interest on that."
1,"Could be. But I would say, equally, given the synergies, the complementary products, we see opportunities in other markets where we're actually going to gain and grow the business. So we're not   we're not concerned about that."
1,"Cross-functional teams we have formed in these new sites are leveraging best-in-class service tools and processes to deliver exceptional service to clients across the HCM spectrum in a cost-efficient manner. At the same time, this allows us to better transfer knowledge among these service teams and offer robust career opportunities within the service organization. I'm proud of these efforts and of the speed of execution, despite the pressure that comes from our client calendar year-end service deliverables."
1,"Currently, approximately 50% of the forecast comparative property NOI growth for 2018 is through contractual rent steps, and more than half of the remainder is through the full-year impact of the increased occupancy in Eastern Canada. So, we feel confident about that growth and will strive to do better. Within our portfolio, we are continuing to drive organic growth through continued contractual rental increases and increasing rental spreads primarily in Ontario and Quebec."
1,"Currently, the PBGC charges pension plans a variable expense of just over 3% on underfunded pension obligations. Moving our pension plan towards fully funded status allows us to reduce future volatility, as we can now better match our asset returns with the liability payments. We will give more color on the P&L impact of these actions when we share our fiscal 2019 guidance next quarter."
1,"Currently, we have projects in place that will address the need to standardize and automate several of our key work processes. It is my expectation that this improvement will allow us to reduce work and be more efficient in target areas of the company. Additional projects, we have launched are focused on designing the optimum manufacturing footprint to ensure we address excess capacity where it exist, ensure our SG&A spend is aligned to our recent margin results and further integrate the back office activities across the various business units."
1,"Delivering the best connectivity products and services for aviation starts with bandwidth. We are at an inflection point in terms of bandwidth, where bandwidth allows us to engage more users whether that's passengers, pilots or crew. Increased bandwidth equals increased take rates, which translates into more revenue and drives profitability."
1,"Down at the bottom of that slide there, you can see there   I'll let you see that for yourself. But we see significant opportunities continuing in Korea and we aim to leverage those over the term. On to slide 34."
1,"Due to employee realignment after a full year of the Dialog integration, we ended the year with 67 employees compared to 70 in the prior year. Although we've significantly increased the depth of our customer engagements in fiscal 2017, the partnership form with Dialog allows us to forego the need to build that expensive global support and operations normally required to support commercial growth, which we expect in 2018. Total non-GAAP selling and general administrative expenses grew by only $900,000 year-over-year to $9."
1,"During 2017, we made significant investments in our business and expanded our service offerings. We believe that we have established a foundation that will allow us to provide long-term sustainable growth and believe we are well positioned to offer a wide variety of services to our clients. And acquisition of Symphony Health has gone very well and I'm delighted with their performance."
1,"During that time, it has matured nicely. The productivity of that network has risen pretty substantially, and we see the opportunity actually to take some actions now to further tighten that network, drive more units through the remaining facilities to further improve our efficiencies as we see opportunity in that productivity that is running so well. That network is running extremely well."
1,"During the past quarter, we made significant progress in addressing certain quality issues with our business partners. We believe this multi-year restyling program will allow us to increase capacity in a capital-efficient and customer-focused way. As part of our comprehensive fleet review, we continue to explore options for our E190 fleet."
1,"During the quarter, we made excellent progress in all four sprint lanes of the WOLVERINE WAY FORWARD, our holistic enterprise-wide transformation of the company. This work has helped us harvest significant efficiencies that will allow us to achieve our 12% operating margin target well ahead of our original schedule, all while providing investment capacity to fuel our growth initiatives. We are pleased to say that the heavy lifting is behind us, with the store closures, portfolio changes, and organizational restructuring now complete."
1,"E15 is a great fuel for cars with a higher octane rating and lower cost at the pump than the standard 10% blends. We are working diligently with the entire industry for E15 and higher blends to gain RVP parity with the standard blend, which will allow us to be sold 12 months of the year across the country. The low cost, low carbon, high octane and growing supply of ethanol is driving new ethanol demand in transportation fuel markets."
1,"Economic growth remains solid, employment and wages continue to rise and consumer confidence remains historically strong. Although constraints on labor and lot availability may provide some guardrails for the rate of building activity, our builder and dealer customers see significant opportunity to serve continued pent up demand and are optimistic for a strong 2018. For 2018, we expect single family housing starts to increase by nearly 10% with total starts approaching 1."
1,"Emphasis in Poland has shifted towards driving greater efficiency in the manufacturing of these products than we had prior to the moves. This allows us to use that created capacity, by bringing in work that had previously been outsourced where Bydgoszcz offers us a cost improvement. With the completion of actions this year, we're pleased to report that Bydgoszcz will have achieved our targeted cost and efficiency."
1,"EP is a Chinese company having its focus on entry level warehouse equipment. The exclusive strategic partnership will allow us to capitalize on growth in the global warehouse market. Operationally in March, we announced that we are expanding the Dematic's European production footprint with a new factory in the Czech Republic next to our ITS factory."
1,"Equally important, our key financial metrics remain significantly ahead of our competitive set, with industry-leading operating margins well over 30% and returns on invested capital over 20%. The efficiency of our business model allows us to translate this growth into strong free cash flow, which has enabled us to return capital back to our shareholders through our growing dividend stream, share buybacks and special dividends such as the recently announced $1 per share special dividend to be paid in late April of this year. So with that, let me turn the call over to Paul for his comments."
1,"Every single time that we have put money and CapEx in that market, the returns have been very, very positive and the payback very quick; this is what we're going to do. We still think that despite being the biggest, we have a significant opportunity there. And the same story in UAE, being a smaller operation, extremely efficient and profitable with our return significantly above its cost of capital."
1,"Excelling at safety and service is of the utmost importance to all of our businesses. We believe we have significant opportunities to enhance the safety and service performance at Swift. While the teamwork we are witnessing and the opportunities ahead of us give us confidence, we continue to face a challenging driver environment."
1,"Excluding those two businesses from the portfolio, the deferred revenue balance would have been around 9%. Stepping back, we do have a very strong balance sheet and that means the financial strength that allows us to focus on transforming our business. Over the past year, we've proactively used cash and Penguin Random House disposal proceeds to reduce our debt maturities and substantially eliminate financing risk."
1,"Facility has some capacity available, which we think is extremely opportune both in terms of its geographic footprint and the scale and diversity of what they do at that site. It will allow us to expand smoothly into new space as we need it probably in lieu of building it out somewhere else. So, we think this will be a highly strategic facility addition to our portfolio and one that expands our capabilities in a few new areas, but also expands some of the areas that we are currently participating in in a more robust way."
1,"Fewer and fewer and fewer people used over time. And this allows us to give us good gross margins, this allows us to curate data accurately and reproducibly none of those competitors have anything on the backend for curating data. And none of those competitors are gaining a foothold because they don't have that and they don't have the clinical evidence that we have."
1,"Fifth, while we are eliminating the allocations of resources to parts of our Leasing and Mortgage divisions we are simultaneously committing greater resources within our Community Banking, Indirect Lending, and Trust and Wealth Management divisions. This will allow us to capitalize on the success and momentum we achieved in 2017 with some of our non-CRE lending products, including small business, SBA, poultry, business aviation, and indirect marine and RV loans, and within our Trust and Wealth Management business. We believe this reallocation of resources will be favorable in all respects, enhancing future growth, profitability, and asset quality."
1,"Finally from an infrastructure standpoint, we'll accelerate activities around supply chain network optimization as well as investments in supply chain systems that enable buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities. We are confident these investments will allow us to continue to deliver industry-leading sales and earnings growth while making us a more competitive employer, improving the guest experience and allowing us to invest in growth platforms to drive sustainable differentiation, exceptional market share gains and long-term success. Before I turn over to Scott, I'd like to address the topic of the recent lawsuits alleging that Ulta Beauty has resold used products."
1,"Finally, and I talked about this a little bit before, across the board now, like we did for shopping, we're going to implement continuous availability architectures. And this platform model, this infrastructure approach we're taking will allow us to do that in a uniform way across the company. We will essentially share all the patterns and will share all the infrastructure that allows us to do that kind of design across all of our applications."
1,"Finally, as Sean have discussed, we are looking to increase the number of partners within our network in the coming year. While this model greatly drives test revenue, we see opportunity to increase the number of partners seeking hybrid solutions that involve both sponsored testing as well as the creation or expansion of patient networks. Depending on the rate at which we see partnership activity accelerate, we could see meaningful upside to currently forecasted revenue both in the form of increased volume as well as non-test revenue."
1,"Finally, capital spending will be subsiding from last year's peak level as we've completed a large percentage of our investments to support our new business backlog. The combination of these factors will allow us to efficiently convert more than 100% of our profit growth into free cash flow. Slide 13 provides an overview of our revised financial targets for next year."
1,"Finally, the third source of growth is acquisition of Axiare through a tender offer that we've just finished. This will allow us to bring Colonial to a level of around â‚¬10 billion of GAV, close to 2 million square meters of GLA. Most of all, our GRI will now show a potential of more than â‚¬500 million, which is very, very significant with an enhanced exposure to Spain, to Madrid in particular remaining with a very unparalleled offer in Grade A projects."
1,"Finally, we already have the largest customer base and network. So, we are confident that our strategy will allow us to increase the number of products sold and also become a leader in loan distribution and non-life insurance. Poste has clearly shown in the past with Poste Vita, PostePay, and PosteMobile that once we enter a new business, we know the way to become the leader."
1,"Finally, we will utilize approximately $300 million to sustainably return capital to shareholders through quarterly dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. As you may know, we currently have a $100 million share repurchase authorization in place and we expect to be active and deploy that authorization as and when we see opportunity in the share price. Furthermore, as we announced, our board has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0."
1,"Finally, we'll continue to drive a culture high performance by further improving transparency and executing our systematic processes to ensure both assets and resources are allocated to the highest growth and profit opportunities. In summary, we feel confident we can make progress growing the value of Elementis in 2018. We've made a good start to the year and expect to make progress in Personal Care, Coatings and Energy."
1,"Finally, we're in the process of liquidating the business and selling the building. With these distractions behind us and significant opportunities on the packaging and U. S."
1,"Finally, yesterday, we announced the sale of our Central Appalachia division. The sale of these thermal coal assets makes Corsa a pure-play metallurgical coal producer and allows us to shed environmental and end of mine closure liabilities in Tennessee. Thermal coal is off strategy for Corsa and this divestiture enables our management team to dedicate a 100% of its time and resources towards growth on the metallurgical side."
1,"First and foremost, we will be focused on adding top-tier originators to our origination software platform. In fact, we feel confident that another top 20 lender will sign an agreement to use our solution before the end of this year. And we will continue to target our existing relationships in servicing to drive additional origination software signings in 2018."
1,"First, as John, I think and I shared, about 25% of the tax benefit is going into acceleration of investments that are predominantly focused on growth. I see some pretty significant opportunities to, one, simplify our business in terms of system migrations and getting us to our destination platforms, plus investing in digital capabilities and product development modularization. And those are things that we had started already, and that we are continuing to accelerate."
1,"First, by immediately harnessing the expertise of Janssen, we believe we can optimize the clinical strategy and execution of TD-1473 which is of particular value in the competitive field of inflammatory bowel disease or IBD. Also this deal allows us to accelerate and expand the scope of the development program as we announced today, with a plan to pursue multiple indications in parallel starting in 2018. And finally, our goal is to maximize the worldwide commercial opportunity for TD-1473 for Theravance Biopharma and our shareholders and we think having Janssen as our partner now in advance of our registrational programs will enhance the overall probability of success and support achievement of this objective."
1,"First, in addition to normal ongoing upkeep of our restaurants, for which we would typically invest around $10,000 per restaurant, or around $24 million, we'll invest another $50 million to fund the new refresh and maintenance program that Steve introduced. This $50 million is a discrete one-time investment that will average about $20,000 per restaurant and it will allow us to fully assess the interiors of every single restaurant, improve efficiencies, ensure that the environments are warm and welcoming for our guests. This focus on improving our restaurants is also driving higher maintenance and repair expenses, which we expect will continue throughout 2018."
1,"First, it will provide more predictability with respect to our dividends, while reducing dividend volatility. And second, it allows us to retain our net performance-related earnings stream to fund future growth or for potential accretive share repurchases. Lastly, the election also reduces the operational complexity of managing a publicly-traded partnership including the requirement to send out Schedule K-1s."
1,"First, our product. We believe we have a significant opportunity to serve a broader audience, while staying true to the heritage of J. Crew and Madewell."
1,"First, relative to further accelerating organic growth, as Eric indicated, we view 2018 as a transition year. As we step into 2019 and beyond, we believe, we'll have significant opportunity to open new markets in adjacent counties. We are aided by the fact that we have deep collaborative accountable care relationships in multiple states, in multiple markets that are highly attractive for us for growth."
1,"For CGM, there will be significant opportunities as the private sector plays a greater role in the infrastructure over time. There's clearly a very significant investment in infrastructure acquired, some of which will continue to be supported by government."
1,"For example, for full year fiscal 2017, we packed 300,000 additional fresh lemon cartons versus the same prior year period for $400,000 less cost. In 2018, we expect to generate greater efficiencies as this new facility will allow us to efficiently manage the planned growth in our fresh lemon volume for our own acreage as it becomes productive as well as additional third-party grower lemons, which we're actively recruiting. The new packing facility has the capacity to double 2017's lemon volume and as we increase volume, efficiencies will continue to improve."
1,"For example, in catalyst technologies, we've identified opportunities to reduce the numbers of small, slow turn products. This, of course, also allows us to review stock levels and destock across areas, helping us reduce non-precious metal working capital. Another example is in gas reforming."
1,"For example, we believe that our evolving skin care portfolio has great runway with global skin care even larger than global color cosmetics. We have significant opportunity to expand brand penetration. Our direct channels are the engine that drives our entire business model and we continue to see strong growth potential."
1,"For full year 2017, base oils represented 31% of our sales, while 45% was finished products and 24% was light products and intermediates. Going forward, we see a significant opportunity to high grade a portion of our existing base oil sales into higher finished product sales. On average finished products realized a margin uplift of approximately $50 per barrel over base oils."
1,"For Lamb Weston specifically, the Hermiston expansion enables us to continue to support our customers' growth plans. It allows us to support increasing demand in North America as well as exports to Asia where demand growth has been and is expected to remain strong. It will increase our investment in the community by adding 170 full-time positions and generate an attractive rate of return for our shareholders."
1,"For our current clients, we continue to seek opportunities to introduce digital technologies to streamline and improve the programs we operate, so we achieve the outcomes that matter most to them. Beyond protecting our base through practical innovation, this transformation allows us to also pursue and develop digital offerings that will provide new revenue streams and help drive long-term growth. The second area that's of particular interest and priority is what I refer to as our ongoing clinical evolution."
1,"For the full-year, core G&A prior to NPH costs were $712 million, a growth rate of about 2%. Looking forward to 2018, we plan to stay focused on productivity and efficiency, and we see opportunities to invest for organic growth, especially given the combined benefits of the current macro environment, tax reform and our NPH acquisition. Therefore, we plan to increase our core G&A growth rate prior to NPH to around 3% to 5% for 2018 for an outlook range of $730 million to $750 million."
1,"For the time being, I'll just reiterate, we're very excited to add Centa to the Rexnord family and that we're convinced that the acquisition will enable us to create and deliver significant incremental shareholder value. One final comment, with the acquisition set to close in our fourth quarter, I'll point out that the combination of purchase price multiple and our expected free cash flow in the quarter will allow us to be leverage-neutral from where we are today, with further delevering accelerating into FY 2019. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark."
1,"For this, we demonstrate Dollar and Thrifty best practices where counter-bypass has long been prevalent. Finally, we're improving our digital capabilities, which will allow us to merchandise better through our website at the point of reservation, as we confirm the reservation and, again, as we acknowledge the reservation on the day of pickup. As our technology initiative expands, marketing opportunities will multiply."
1,"For Vistara, just last week we launched a new requisition form to integrates Vistara on a single requisition form with our other products. We will continue to bring this product along carefully, but we think this change will allow us to broaden access to more accounts. We are very encouraged with the progress we've seen on cord blood in Q4 and so far this year."
1,"Fortunately, last year, we got our permit for the Los Angeles project which we started working on immediately. It's a very attractive project for us because it allows us to take our business and combine the two separate refineries in Los Angeles that we own into one facility and realize very significant benefits. Especially, if IMO develops like people expect, we have the capability to make about 40,000 barrels a day more of distillates, both diesel and jet fuel instead of gasoline and if people's views on crack spreads for diesel materialize in 2020, it will be very lucrative to us as a company."
1,"Fourth, group support functions, information technology, real estate and the consumer incubation elements within Nokia Technologies are all areas where further cost reduction potential remains. And we see opportunity for further structural cost reductions after 2018. As we move to put integration-related savings behind us, we will turn our attention to these areas."
1,"Fourth, MTS is a significant benefactor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was enacted in December of last year. This tax reform will significantly reduce our tax burden, and with roughly 65% of our sales being outside the United States will allow us to more readily repatriate our foreign earnings. Our priorities for cash usage remain the same that is investment in our businesses for continued growth in the face of strengthening markets, payment of our dividend to our shareholders, and continued deleveraging of our balance sheet."
1,"Fourth, Nektar keeps 65% of global profits for NKTR-214, the majority of the profits. Importantly, this new collaboration allows us to gain access to the extensive resources and infrastructure of Bristol-Myers Squibb to expedite Phase 3 development starting in the middle of 2018 and the majority of the Phase 3 registrational trials with Opdivo will be paid for by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Finally, we retain the ability to develop NKTR-214 with other anti-cancer agents."
1,"From a domestic perspective, we experienced continued strength in our corporate payments business. We had a number of key wins in this segment in 2017 that we believe will allow us to continue to drive volume growth, highlighted by Uvet, sgfleet, Lotus Travel and Profit Travel. The Travel and Corporate Payments market is vast."
1,"From a hedging perspective, we ended the quarter approximately 13% to 16% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross commodity hedges. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at market fundamentals, and particularly as we see opportunity for PJM price formation chances. Turning to slide 16, our O&M expense outlook is consistent with the third quarter earnings call disclosures."
1,"From a strategic benefit perspective, as mentioned before, it's a nice addition to our Hydraulics and Electronics business, the portfolio broadens the offering. It expands our footprint predominantly into Europe and it allows us to pursue the concept of in the region for the region. We strongly believe that that is a key success factor moving forward from here."
1,"From an increased focus of driving organic revenue growth and increased focus on financial discipline, we've been able to deliver a very good operating leverage through the first nine months. And as we gave guidance in October, at the midpoint of guidance, guiding to EPS of 29% for the year, we still see significant opportunity as I said earlier to complete the journey on profitability in 2018 and we'll be committed to maintaining good discipline on our expense management and investment to succeed in completing that journey in 2019. So strategic goals for us are very straightforward, drive organic revenue growth."
1,"From both a strategic and financial perspective, we believe this is a highly attractive transaction for our franchise and shareholders. First Evanston provides us with improved scale and allows us to expand our presence into attractive markets. This enhances both our overall market position and ability to continue to generate organic growth in the future."
1,"From departments, we still have opportunity in larger ticket, building materials, special order kitchens, lumber. While lumber has certainly run up in price, the project is simply still growing and we still have significant opportunities. So from a department perspective, we see more continued growth in those departments."
1,"From our testing, we think that our voice and Q&A based technologies can cover more keywords and provide more accurate answers, this allows us to build upon our competitive advantage against our peers."
1,"From that construct which is 1% price, 2% to 3% of the underlying volume of the market that's growing. And then 3% to 4% of this mix shift where we will sell more value, more revenue, and more margin per unit sold, that's the mix shift that we talk about, will allow us to expand gross margins by about 50 basis points to 70 basis points through that mix shift on average. And then the additional leverage through SG&A, and as well as on the operational efficiencies in our 28 manufacturing facilities across the globe will allow us to get approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion on the operating margin level."

And then the additional leverage through SG&A and as well as on the operational efficiencies in our 28 manufacturing facilities across the globe will allow us to get approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion on the operating margin level."
1,"From the Ionis perspective, we were already planning for inotersen and volanesorsen commercial revenue this year, to add to our growing Spinraza revenue and our substantial base of R&D revenue. The transaction with Akcea will allow us to add substantially more of the commercial upside of inotersen to these other sources of commercial revenue, while also benefiting from the synergies created by Akcea. We believe this transaction should maximize the commercial value of both inotersen and volanesorsen and Ionis' commercial participation in both drugs."
1,"Full service engagement, we are looking for opportunities to become basically a full service end-to-end revenue cycle partner for our clients such that we can bring service offerings, operational process flows, et cetera to manage that entire revenue cycle process for them. Good example of that, there'll be an announcement officially next week, Cerner's entering into a strategic partnership with Parallon, whereby we will be leveraging their bad debt Medicaid eligibility and their early-out service offerings, which again we believe will allow us to manage that entire process flow end-to-end. Fourth pillar is really what I call management execution."
1,"Further, we are also storing all the relevant customer data which gives us a very large and growing data repository for the future. This not only gives us the capability to provide more analytics, but it allows us to be able to compare and review these large datasets with our customers as they embark on future product developments. We've also started a number of initiatives in the company to make us more efficient and competitive for the future."
1,"Gail Roboz who will serve as the Principal Investigator of this study and with her colleagues Dana-Farber, MD Anderson, Johns Hopkins, Moffitt, and Cleveland Clinic. We expect that the involvement of these leading centers will allow us to rapidly enroll this study. We'll have more detail on the Actimab-MDS study following our meeting with the FDA in the next few months."
1,"Geoff's clearly articulated three areas of focus, quality, technology and loyalty, continued to drive our actions throughout 2017. Our hotel company has grown to have more affiliated hotels than any other organization in the world with an exceptionally strong footprint and significant opportunity for continued growth. Our brands garnered four of the top five economy hotel spots in the 2017 J."
1,"Given our expertise and balance sheet strength, we are well-positioned to take advantage of attractive market opportunities to generate shareholder value. Our diversified model allows us to focus on the lines of business that offer the most compelling returns. And with our strong balance sheet, successful business model and conservative capital structure, we are confident in our ability to continue to effectively execute."
1,"Given the intense quality requirement that is mandated by regulators and our customers, we are well positioned to secure awards for parts and services in this space. We do see a bit contraction in the overall energy market, but again, our plans and projections are based on penetration of our nuclear and conventional power installed base and we see opportunities for any improvement on the OE market as upside to our plan. Overall, for the Power and Energy segment, we're focused on improving our customers' experience."
1,"Given the success of this collaborations, we have agreed to be Pinners' title sponsor for 2018 which has grown to six U. S cities and will allow us to continue to target a new group of potential loyal lifetime customers. The first conference in 2018 is in San Diego in mid-April."
1,"Going back to 2015, when you take into account sales accompanying restaurants, Buy & Flips and franchise to franchise transfers, almost 40% of the North American system has changed hands. We view this as healthy turnover as it allows us to strengthen our system by ensuring restaurants are in the hands of strong operators with access to capital that are committed to growth with a long-term focus. Going forward, transactions that were previously referred to as Buy & Flips will now be called Franchise Flips due to our decision to be more selectively involved in the related real estate."
1,"Going forward in 2018, we will continue to have a number of opportunities to improve our overall capital structure and reduce our cost of capital. First, there are significant opportunities to work with our smaller landlords to restructure leases with below market coverage. Second, we will continue to pursue refinancing our bridge loans with lower cost mortgages."
1,"Going forward, we will operate our business under the assumption that the next 12 to 18 months could deliver flattish revenues in Firearms. Should market conditions change, our flexible manufacturing model allows us to quickly ramp production. In the meantime, we will focus on optimizing our manufacturing resources to align capacity with demand, while preparing for a number of meaningful new product launches, reducing costs across the entire organization and generating cash, growing our business and particularly our Outdoor Products business organically through the development of new products across our well-known and respected consumer brands."
1,"Going to slide 8 now, in terms of free cash flow, in 2017 this totaled $178 million, which is about 56% higher than 2016. The ability of our company to generate cash is a key competitive advantage of Kirkland Lake Gold as an investment, it allows us to invest also to achieve one of our key pillars of value creation, which is organic growth, using the existing cash and not having to dilute share. Now going to slide 9 and looking at our balance sheet."
1,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Referencing slide 16, 2017 was indeed quite a transformational year for the South African region, with a restructuring that will allow us to safely return this business to profitability and a sustainable future. We've, obviously, also been very sensitive to the need to minimize job losses throughout that process."
1,"Great thing about two-sided marketplace is that they scale really nicely. So, we believe that there is significant opportunity for our margin to grow over time and there is no reason it shouldn't look like other scaled marketplaces over time. We announced that the restructuring we did last year would have about a $35 million incremental impact on margins this year in 2018, but you know I do want to emphasize that the reason we did the restructuring last year was first and foremost to make us go faster."
1,"Growth will be more of a consequence of our focus on these areas rather than further geographic expansion. There is a significant opportunity for growth in these regions, especially because of the younger population and a high birth rate. We are also seeing continuous growth in the more established regions, including the EU5, where we have been present for more than four years."
1,"Having said so, that clear focus on what our target customers are and what the opportunities are and see, for us, the opportunities are $20 million, $30 million, $50 million opportunities, right. What it allows us to do on the R&D side as well as on the go-to-market is we can make trade-offs in what we develop, which is specific to these types of opportunities that our competition cannot make the same trade-offs. They make different trade-offs, right, and you mentioned a couple of them, and they might, therefore, be very well suited for the next 5,000 or 20,000 companies out here."
1,"Having said that, we are focused on taking the reins at accelerating our progress through decisive action, in just a moment, Bill Burns will provide more details on how we are positioning ourselves to achieve this milestone. To conclude, while we are not satisfied with last quarter's results, we believe there is significant opportunity ahead of us as an organization and a clear pathway to getting there. I'm confident in our team and the changes we have already made and believe we will build momentum as we move through the year."
1,"He was also in Envision between that time as well. And Danny is frankly the best in this business, and Danny has improved wherever he's gone, bad debt expense, I think there's significant opportunity there, Dave. But along those lines is that there are things we could be doing better on the front end."
1,"Here, we saw strong order and revenue growth of 49% and 59%, respectively. We already have more than 1 million customers in both Spain and Italy, but there remains significant opportunity to move customers from telephone to online. We estimate 85% of takeaway food in Spain is still ordered by telephone, and this number exceeds 90% in Italy."
1,"Hi, Matt. GDPR, I think, or any other phenomenon that drives awareness for companies to build better security defenses is a good thing for us because it allows us to get in front of people that have budget and show how differentiated we are from our competitors. So I think we've got a good talk track on GDPR, and more importantly, it's backed up with supremely better security."
1,"Hi, Patrick. First of all, yes, we do see some significant opportunities with Gen 10. 5."
1,"Historically, there was no way to see multiple scenes at the same time or to better manage our assets as they're spread throughout a municipality. We're going to talk a lot more about this in the next few months, but this is absolutely intended to be an enabling technology, a connective technology that will allow us to stay closer to our customers to enhance the intimacy with them post-sale and then to bring more value again to the total system versus an SCBA as a discrete piece of protective equipment. So, that concludes my area on growth."
1,"Hopefully the public market discount to private market values will narrow in the near-future. In closing, the embedded growth from our development pipeline and our low leverage balance sheet allows us to be patient during this current market dislocation. Furthermore, the P3 market remains very attractive and we're very well-positioned to seize these opportunities."
1,"housing market outlook, we believe this business will remain stable and profitable. Furthermore, we see significant opportunities to prudently invest in high-return capital projects in this segment, as it is an integral part of the supply chain to our High Purity business. From slide 9, our Pulp and Paper segment comprises four facilities in three locations across Canada, which produce paperboard, high-yield pulp and newsprint."
1,"How do we get greater utilization rates out of our factories as an example, Paul. We manufacture in five different factories across the globe and we have significant opportunities to improve utilization. We also have a new leader over our Hardware organization that joined us really midway through the calendar year last year with a great experience coming from GE."
1,"However, a key element of our multi-boutique model is that it provides us with opportunities to selectively partner with distinctive boutiques and support their growth by offering their strategies in a different product structures and providing access to our distribution resources. Our model allows us to partner with the right firm for particular capability by having a flexible approach to partnering, thereby not limiting our opportunity set. We have successfully leveraged our multi-boutique model over the years to expand our affiliated managers with the establishment of Newfleet in 2011, adding Rampart in 2012, Virtus ETF Solutions in 2015, and Seix, Ceredex, and Silvant through the RidgeWorth acquisition in 2017."
1,"However, as our list of potential customers grow, we are now starting to see deviations from this linear-phased approach to licensing our technology. For example, we are now talking to customers about licensing much earlier in the process, which will allow us to cement our relationship earlier, and will allow them a wider investigation of our technology. Slide 6."
1,"However, we anticipate an offsetting impact in 2018 from the one specific customer's inventory management which we expect will lead to a more modest overall growth rate for the full year of 2018. Going forward, we believe the large and growing Orthopedic and Advanced Surgical market provides us with significant opportunities to leverage our capabilities in implants, instruments in arthroscopy in particular. Turning to slide 16."
1,"I agree that one of the reasons this company is positioned as well as I think it is in the government and defense space is because of that agility. It's because our size, as we continue to grow, allows us to take innovation, implement and execute at a pace that our competitors can't in the market space. And we're going to take advantage of that."
1,"I am delighted to announce that we will be launching our new branded fares across the next few weeks, offering our passengers a wider choice of products that are tailored to their needs. These will allow us to better segment the business and optimize revenue by increasing the number of price points. From an operational perspective, as we continue our drive focusing on what our customers truly value   operational excellence, I am very happy to say that during 2017 we delivered 146 days with 100% completion factor."
1,"I am pleased with the efforts of this team to develop this project inventory. As we look ahead, renewable diesel is a significant opportunity for us to grow, and we are committing resources to evaluate the best avenues for growth in this product line. Earlier in 2017, we purchased land in Geismar in connection with our expansion plans."
1,"I am very bullish. I think, we're in a terrific shape and I think the way that the team have ring fenced the excess and the way that we deal with, that really helps us with   also not settling for a negotiated solution that is to our disadvantage because we've dealt with it in a ring fenced way that allows us to   to allow that to play out. So, I think that's really positive."
1,"I can tell you that this is the solution that can win the country in terms of the e-commerce. And that will allow us to take everyone else's e-commerce customers and with the data and the customers then you start taking the bricks and mortar customers. So that's why it's so important to us, it's not just e-commerce, it's everything else that comes along with it."
1,"I don't think that we have provided a specific number like that, but I can understand those kinds of numbers. And I would say is that we see significant opportunity as a result of the inefficiency of the buy that Terex has historically done, and so there's a lot of opportunity out there and we intend to maximize it."
1,"I fully expect that our more focused software and services-centric strategy will position us to profitably participate in the disruptive initiatives ongoing across the telecommunications industry. The previously discussed market trends will allow us to accelerate our Software-Systems revenue, given a differentiation and value-add our products and services capabilities provide. And as I mentioned earlier, we are fixated on returning the company back to non-GAAP profitability, accelerating the conversion rate of our funnel, and creating more customer diversification, all of which should return our valuation to more appropriate levels, and over time, drive increase in shareholder value."
1,"I guess, you can say, we have two central fill facilities both for filling prescriptions for our own pharmacies as well as mail order for ours and a few others, third parties. We're building a major chicken plant in Nebraska that will allow us to source ourselves about 100 million chickens a year, which is less than a quarter of our needs, although another third to 40% of our needs are sourced in the business what's referred to as dedicated plants. We're not the only one that does it, using one of the three or four large providers, that we share in all the profitability and cost related to that plant."
1,"I have the privilege of seeing the entire operation and seeing some phenomenal things that our people are doing in space, rotorcraft, fighters, 787 services, and taking those best practices and driving them across Boeing. And I think we've done a good job, but we have a significant opportunity. And Services was a key objective of doing that like we talked about, but efficiency like they said on the 787."
1,"I hear you. I mean, we would love to think that a couple of big opportunities are going to come around to really lever up the balance sheet and make some great investments that will allow us to get a great return on invested capital. If we don't have those things, I think I'd go back to   we're looking for growth."
1,"I look forward to sharing more details as they come to market. Lastly, we made significant progress in the quarter towards developing our new distribution center in Missouri, a long-term objective that is well under way and will allow us to better serve our wholesale and retail customers. The precast walls have been installed, the steel roof installation is under way, and most of the underground utilities and mechanicals are complete."
1,"I mean having an element of the company that's public, while still having an anchored shareholder with incredibly long-term view, I think, is the optimal combination in today's environment. The public component gives us a broader tool kit that we can use for a consolidation going forward, it allows us to think of some creative structures in that space and it also over time provides some liquidity if some of our private partners need to exercise some liquidity in an organized fashion. So, that combination again with a controlling shareholder who has a credibly long-term view and a great track record is something that I'm personally very excited about; again, I think is the right model."
1,"I mean I think that we use all of the tools and tool box there with respect to our deposit categories. And from time to time, we'll have a promotional strategy on churn, which allows us to control cannibalization and other things that may happen in a promotional approach. But we're even more pleased with our DDA growth, and really that's been the big driver of all of the initiatives that you're hearing about coming out of the Consumer space with all the investments that we're making there in terms of better pricing and investment and data and analytics and the targeting that we're doing there from a digital perspective."
1,"I mean we're very focused on loan growth in the areas that we have said we're investing around. So cross-border and I think we've talked about this before on the call, Ebrahim, that we believe we continue to have a significant opportunity serving Chinese clients that already are established in the United States. There are significant numbers of these companies where we don't have relationships or deep relationships and so that's a very significant area of opportunity for us to continue growing."
1,"I mean, certainly, if you look at our water/wastewater initiative, I'd call that   most people would call that horizontal as well, so that's part of it. But we're looking at certain geographies, BC being one of them where there are some significant opportunities that we have the skill sets onboard, we have executed some smaller stuff and are graduating too. I would call it meaningful for that group, but not meaningful for the Buildings Group all together."
1,"I mean, first, our highest and biggest focus is as we've been saying to invest in the business and to generate organic growth and to fund that organic growth. And so sitting here today, we think we continue to have very significant opportunities and so we're going to be   we're not going to be quick to make any decisions or changes in our policies to ensure that we continue to serve customers and continue to support the investment in the business we've talked about and the organic growth that we've talked about. And obviously that's something we'll revisit as we go through the year and we see how things play out from a competitive standpoint, from a growth standpoint et cetera."
1,"I mean, I guess, again, we benefit from an extremely strong asset base, we benefit from an extremely strong growth profile both from our sponsor and also our third-party customers as well. So, it allows us to be extremely selective in the investment opportunities that we have, but I mean, as you say, all of those opportunities are available to us and they're all things that we're looking at in considering. But again, we can be highly selective on the opportunities that we bring forward and bring into the portfolio, so they have to make economic sense, they have to create value for HESM unitholders and they have to be strategically connected to our business strategy."
1,"I mean, I think   one thing we are doing you know other than Rio Nance 6, the capacity that we will be adding will definitely be at the low cost curve. So we're going to have incremental capacity in all of our facilities which will allow us to reduce our costs and minimize our CapEx really and get better returns on our capital."
1,"I mean, that's the beauty of this. I mean, the structure that we've got established with Targa allows us to further grow processing capacity in the South if we want. We each have the option to participate in further expansion of processing, but we also have the expansion of the Tioga Gas Plant in the north as well."
1,"I mean, the CUV/SUV market in Seating is a big opportunity for us and the content is increasing at 2%, 3% when we look at it in that segment. So that's a significant opportunity for us in how we position ourselves. On the Electric side, the E-Systems side of the business, if it's referenced to the content side, it's more of the growth story of what we're doing with the trends and the major trends that we see."
1,"I mean, we mentioned the partner platform being a competitive advantage. This will allow us to quickly scale our assortment as we grow. And so this shows our partner growth, but our assortment is growing nicely with it."
1,"I mentioned that even Apoquel is not yet approved in China and we expect approval in the future. So, definitely, it's a significant opportunity of growing our dermatology portfolio outside of the U. S."
1,"I mentioned this back in July when we were here, I mentioned that in the Capital Markets Day, and I suspect you will hear me mention that many more times in the foreseeable future. And another opportunity, we clearly have available is our Global Excellence Centers, which right now make up about 10% of our total population and has significant opportunity for growth. And if we use that right, then we're not just creating growth in the Global Excellence Centers but we will also be able to create growth in those organizations and those centers in the Western world who cooperate with the Global Excellence Centers."
1,"I started in this industry well over 30 years ago by building hotels. We've got the internal expertise to do that and by utilizing the operating expertise of Island Hospitality, we know we could cherry-pick a market where we see opportunity, outsized opportunity that will deliver unlevered yields of at least 9% to 10% over time. And finally of course, we'll continue to invest in our own portfolio."
1,"I think   obviously, if we are turning our eye towards capital raise, we'd look at the opportunities within debt and equity and also some corporate situations that we have. I think the biggest thing as well as we are very mindful and this is why we spend a bit of time emphasizing the idea of driving that rep productivity and driving that whole cash burn down because the key component here is to make sure that the ultimate need, if you like, is a very reasonable amount and allows us to basically get to the situation where we can drive to profitability in that timeframe."
1,"I think also by adding the alliance into the piece that allows us to contract in just a rig and by keeping the equipment firmly instilled allows quicker mobilizations and demobilizations, which again adds to the efficiency that we have over a rig coming in on a low day rate, spending five days to mobilize its equipment and then starting against the efficiencies that we used to have. So these are the benefits that we can put out there and that mechanism is working very well to date."
1,"I think as far as eSignLive is concerned, this was not an unusual   I would characterize this as any kind of an unusual deal for eSignLive. We do see significant opportunities for growth, as I noted in my comments. eSignLive grew more than 50% in 2017."
1,"I think as we move more and more digital to the frontend, that's again a leverage point for us. So, I think the technology and big data piece of this just allows us to continue to be really smart about how we save in the back room and in our processes to really hopefully reinvest some of that as we continue to invest in technology on the frontend of the business. So, I think that's an opportunity that we continually are focused on."
1,"I think as we said that these opportunities from an RFP perspective will play out this summer and into the fall. We would expect it to ramp up when working, as we get later into the fall and into the fourth quarter and then it could potentially be a very significant opportunity for 2019. I hesitate to pick a growth rate for 2019 or give guidance on a specific percentage."
1,"I think from my perspective, it was a very   the manufacturing capabilities, what they were able to do, the way that I think we believe that this can be scaled up was a very, very important careful consideration on what we are doing. We believe it could be a significant competitive advantage, not only in the speed and quality of the product, but the ability to scale in a way which will allow us to really do new clinical work globally and go into a number of different indications and be able to also, I think importantly obviously, supply the commercial marketplace as well. So it was an area of very careful consideration that we believe ultimately will be an area of competitive advantage for us."
1,"I think if you see decreases in NAND pricing, I think from a product mix shift, we'll be seeing customers deploy more all-flash arrays. I think given the substantial differentiation that we have in that segment, it allows us to capture new footprints and accelerate competitive displacements even faster than we are today. So we are excited at the prospect of NAND pricing coming back in line through this latter part of the summer."
1,"I think in general, we don't have any significant constraints. One of the things that we benefited from over the years is having a balance sheet and a margin profile that allows us to take larger positions in inventory when we see it as an opportunity. And whenever we see pending or possible shortages, we believe with our strong relationships with our suppliers and vendors that we're in a better position than our competitors."
1,I think it's a compound we're incredibly excited about. We think it has significant opportunities also maybe potentially beyond ADHD. We're in the early stages.
1,"I think it's one of the smart things that we do as a company, we've done historically, is we expand before we need to, so we don't run into walls, like growth walls, run out of growth. So, we have significant opportunity in front of us. If you told me all we could do is sell to existing customers, I would tell you we can continue to grow like we are."
1,"I think part of the intent on the growth is still around alignment of key technologies and looking at outcome-based solutions. I think within the domains we've talked about on training, model-based system engineering, readiness, IT modernization, I think we see opportunity to be able to continue to leverage commercial technologies, to be a channel to government, drive the growth through the 2025 elements of our business, really market share in specific segments that we think we've got a good position. We continue to focus on pipeline development on the expand-and-grow side, to make sure we can expand capabilities as well as seek adjacencies with new customers."
1,"I think that this is a figure, you should see us at this level for a few years. No, I don't, I want to also make sure like anything we're going to stream that into our decision making as we see opportunities present themselves. If for whatever reason our market slows down then we'll pull back on that capacity, we'll throttle back."
1,"I think the government-related opportunities are a little more clear, but we're seeing a return on the energy side as well. We're bidding on some significant opportunities for some of our historical legacy energy companies. We've been very strong with some of the largest oil and gas services companies, and the return of the price of oil being a little bit stronger has, I think, given them a little bit more confidence."
1,"I think the one thing that I would suggest where we're very happy with our position is our fiber builds, so the fact that we're building out Western Canada and we're going to crossover that 50% this year 60%, 70%, but having a successful 5G network is going to be linked to the quality of your fiber build. And so we have a very good network sharing agreement with Bell, they're building out concurrently as well and I think between the combination of the national network and having a very strong fiber footprint, it will allow us to roll out faster with a quality network that I think will be tough to be matched internationally not only in Canada."
1,"I think there are other opportunities. We've got more client request than the eight but from our standpoint we want to make sure that those activations and the capital associated with those activations still allows us to live within cash flow. So, I think, there is some other initiatives that we are undertaking that will help us lower capital cost and dayrates move a little more and we'll see where it goes."
1,"I think there are, over a longer period of time, a lot of ways that we can take advantage of this capability and so short-term I don't know that we   short-term, all of what we expect is wrapped up in our guidance. And it's all kind of within our expectations but I think longer-term it's a really exciting capability that will allow us to personalize the experience at Stitch Fix in more ways than we can today."
1,I think there will still be a role for PD-L1 expression to play to understand where other options and other treatment modalities should be used. But I think the compelling nature of these data and the predictive nature of TMB will allow us to establish a very good presence in the market. I would also say that the partnership with Foundation Medicine has been a good one for us.
1,"I think they regularly price below cost because they don't   that price advantage I was talking about before   one of the reasons we do well in building a purpose-built OS for TV allows us to build players at lower cost. It allows us to sell at $29 Roku Express, on special at $20, and on blended basis have a positive gross margin whereas our competitors hit those price points have to subsidize generally."
1,I think we have in both dimensions. We see opportunities in the newer one as in the more traditional ones.
1,"I think we'll continue to be prudent, the way we've been in historically and look at what are the investment alternatives out there. And if there's attractive returns, we'll certainly deploy the cash where we see opportunities. I do think we want to continue to make investments within the business, which KKR and WMIH are super supportive of around our   we think there's a tremendous opportunity to continue to take out cost and servicing."
1,"I think we're putting a lot of rigor and analytic view on everything we do. Our team's talking a lot, we're testing a lot, and we   as we've shared with many of the examples, are doing a lot of different things, whether it'd be the Ship from Store, and some of the omni-channel initiatives to really speak to how customers want to shop today, to developing a smaller, but I would say more intimate and more size appropriate store that allows us to be very competitive and to be able to fulfill end-of-lease opportunity. So, it's quite a few things happening at once, but I'd say there's a lot of focus and a lot of careful planning."
1,"I think we've got lots of opportunity with automation. Certainly, we've done a lot of automation at our high-volume runners but the advent of collaborative robots and a newer technology and cheaper technology as well will allow us to tackle some of the lower volume items in terms of automation. So I think there's plenty of opportunities there."
1,"I think what the slides refer to as well is that we had not been as active in the M&A field in Japan, but that's changing. In Japan, obviously, we don't need scale, but we are adding capabilities that will allow us to diversify the business domains outside of the traditional marketing sector. The perfect example is the artificial intelligence investment we just recently made."
1,"I think you can use that same example going forward. So where we see opportunities, we'll expand either the banner or assortment or company offerings to our customers to create a much bigger marketplace."
1,"I think, from my perspective, we both have very, very capable chip designers. The combination will allow us to move some of those chip designers, frankly, to 3D sensing, where we've got a very large pipeline of product designs that we're trying to bring to market. So, I think from that perspective, the datacom market is attractive and growing."
1,"I think, turning up with that   with our customer base and obviously, given we're a relatively small company with limited means, we still felt that we should participate in the value of the asset that we were enabling to grow through our customer base. So, we've tried to strike a balance, but made sure we're creating an entity, which is viable and we'll get a good return, but also creating a business that's going to provide us with a wholesale price, that allows us to offer very competitive fiber. So, we're just   we're trying to manage the balance and we want to make sure that we're in real partnership with the people constructing the network."
1,"I want to also cover BillAvenue and I will allow Vishwas subsequently to cover more in detail. BillAvenue is an amazing service that has been launched, which allows us to get a slight share in the utility payment space. You see, there are thousands of utilities and government has created a framework called Bharat BillPay, which there is a licensing too, and in one way the company has created a framework where there are a set of agents, agents who collect utility payments, the way you think of agents are the people who are there outside of a railway station or a kirana store."
1,"I want to thank our employees for their passion and dedication, and I'm grateful to the patients and their families for their contributions to our mission. I joined Alexion about 10 months ago and saw significant opportunity to build and position the company for continued success and increase value creation. Looking at slide 5, I want to take a moment to review the actions we've taken to deliver on our long-term growth objectives."
1,"I want to welcome the talented team from Sandvik to Colfax. This acquisition strengthens our position in these segments and presents a significant opportunity for margin improvement as we take advantage of synergies with our existing business and use our Business System to drive improvements. On slide 6, I would like to provide an update on our Air & Gas Handling segment."
1,I would also add that the advertising and promotion expense increased in the quarter as we gear up for the first quarter 2018 rebranding initiative. This is a program that has been in the works for quite some time and we believe there will be significant opportunities for us resulting from the enhanced awareness of our brand and our capabilities across our footprint during and after the campaign. Loan loss provision in the quarter was up $1.
1,"I would also like to provide an update on our investment in Pure Rooms, a leading provider of hypo-allergenic rooms in the hospitality space. We've seen a growing demand for health and wellness offerings in the hospitality industry and we believe that the investment in Pure Rooms will allow us to bring our industry knowledge and expertise, as well as our managed asset base to the company in order to optimize growth synergistically. The company currently has contracts in place with 177 hotels representing approximately 2,600 rooms throughout the United States, including 52 Ashford asset-managed hotels."
1,"I would assume 2018 is going to be about 2% to 3% of our total sales, we'll round up the year. As far as the long-term three to five-year plan, there's a significant opportunity in front of us to bring to life the same experience we have in the store online and I'm really going to be looking at that in total as far as engagement. So I guess it'll be a little while before I'm in a position to say whether 2% what it becomes in the out years, but there's significant upside from where we're at today."
1,"I would like to provide some commentary of the outlook for each of the operation. At Chapada, we continue to have significant opportunities available to us. The cleaner circuit expansion that we commission in 2017 is supporting higher recoveries and we expect the positive impact to continue in 2018."
1,"I would say our primary focus is looking for opportunities that can drive strong growth in that 2023, 2024, 2025 timeframe. We feel confident that we can drive growth with our late-stage pipeline ahead of that. So we're constantly looking for assets in that timeframe that could help further accelerate our growth in that window."
1,"I would say we're in early innings as it relates to how we're deploying tools and what revenue we have under management. These tools give us the ability to code SKUs as either head, core, or tail items, and through that characterization of a head item, it allows us to govern the competitiveness by which we manage price on highly elastic or highly inelastic SKUs. So, we're able to continue to drive traffic and customer excitement and engagement where necessary and then yield price productivity in the core and tail items throughout the system."
1,"I would say, we have no plans to integrate the actual DSD systems, these are independent distributors, so we'll leave that at that. I think where we really see significant opportunity is we have overlapping warehouse systems, we have overlapping depots. And even before you get to the DSD guide, there's significant opportunity to extract cost synergies and that'll be our focus in the near term."
1,"I would tell you that with the stock in the high-15s and book value at $16. 65, I can't make the math super, super compelling around major buybacks, but it's a tool; and it's meant to be there to be used, and to the extent we see opportunities, we'll use it."
1,"I wouldn't say it's a one-size-fits-all. But I think there's a significant opportunity going at some of this together that again will be a competitive differentiator when we're offering it to our customer. There are areas where they may have more knowledge of that particular system, but I think combined with us, we've got a lot of knowledge of those airplanes that we've designed and developed as well."
1,"IDC designs and manufactures electronic products for aviation, marine, military fighting vehicles and embedded computing markets. This acquisition expands our product offerings to existing customers and allows us to better address market needs. IDC is part of our Radiant Power subsidiary in our ETG Group."
1,"If I can delay that for three months, six months, I can make a real savings to the managed care teams and still give the patient what they want because they want topical treatment. That's the reason why the innovation that we have, we believe, will allow us to work with managed care to get a better outcome for patients and indeed one that's very cost effective. So it's the innovation that we have that is what we think is driving it."
1,"If I can elaborate a bit here, the increased rutile production achieved at Sierra Rutile to-date, has provided us with some optionality around timing of the expansions that underpin the acquisition case. The deferral allows us to focus this year on executing the Lanti and Gangama expansions in Sierra Leone and on the Cataby project in Jacinth-Ambrosia upgrade in Australia. It also allows us to target a smoother rutile production profile and to develop reasonable estimates of Sembehun project cost based on the outcome of the definitive feasibility study that is currently underway."
1,"If they want to have subscriber stability, they need to make sure generationally that they're appealing to younger audience. When you get down to the product, on a daily basis, Newsy has the benefit of a digital back-channel of data, that allows us to really understand what the consumers interested in at that moment. But we don't have any of the sort of trappings of a digital business."
1,"If we   so those were the strategic action areas. If we just comment a little bit on the selling for the future; if we start with the easy part, or not the easy part, it's tricky to do but we feel   with H&M brand, we feel confident that we can grow online sales by more than 25% with all the improvements that we have for 2018. And we feel confident that we can grow our online sales by more than 20% from the years 2019 to 2022."
1,"If we add services like sheet metal right now is   as we acquired it, is operating at about a 40% gross margin. We see opportunities where we can improve that. I don't know that it will get to 60% and probably we don't expect that it will, but as the mix of our business shifts, there might be a little bit of compression in our gross margin, just based on the mix of the business, but ultimately, we're focused on the high-value components that customers value and the total solution that would pull through some of the higher margin business too and allow us to leverage the sales and marketing spend, as well as the fixed infrastructure."
1,"If we are successful in implementing all of our strategic initiatives, we expect the bid pipeline to grow to over $10 billion over time. In the meantime, our strong cash position allows us to choose the projects we foresee until the market recovers. We have made significant inroads into addressing the renewables market, continue to strengthen our position in the largest regional market with our joint venture Saudi Aramco, in Saudi Arabia, and have taken steps to reach the broader EPC market."
1,"If we divided this into two parts, Christopher, we don't   we don't look active at the moment in any specific acquisition, so that had been said. We more have a general understanding and intelligence about the acquisitions we had looked at in contact, we have in the market and knowing that things are out or will come out, so we see opportunity to grow so that is nothing specifically we will come back in as I said again tomorrow next week of saying that we continue to buy again, the focus is on making sure that we implement it   implement those acquisition we have done and specifically Jurys Inn, that is very important message for me to say. So, everybody understands that we are now working more with and focused on maintaining what we have acquired and to acquire new, but with that said, of course, in a capital quarter when we are ready, if we look ahead, and then, what sort of geographic market are we mostly interested."
1,"If we look at   if you look at the combined Wood, our DSO is 86 days and AFW was at 93 days. So, we see that as a significant opportunity to generate cash and better working capital management. To put that in some context, about every day of the combined Wood is about $20 million, that's sort of rough order of magnitude."
1,"If we think we're understaffed in a particular area, we might take more aggressive action, but that's not the case today. And the second thing that we see coming is that, and Doug mentioned it, we continue to make a lot of investments in the technology side and we see opportunities for continued automation and improvement in productivity from our investments in technology. So we think those investments are going to enable our sales force to do a better job of capturing the opportunity in front of them."
1,"If you ask me even with Spectre and Meltdown, one of the things that was just marked difference was not only our ability to take that issue which is a processor design issue come up with a fix and a mitigation, get it deployed say in our cloud very rapidly so no customer had to even spend any money. So, the operational security posture that allows us to see threats and mitigate the threats is as important as the technology itself. So we're investing very, very heavily."
1,"If you could refer to slide 16, clearly we're very excited about the strategic merits of this transaction. This transaction expands our business in key geographies, enhances our portfolio of well-recognized global brands, and allows us to build on our balanced approach to capital allocation. Today's announcement is a result of the hard work and relentless focus of all of our colleagues around the globe to lead with innovation, operate with excellence, and drive productivity."
1,"If you know we are managing the business to create value for our shareholders in the mid- and long-term, and I think I'm proud to say here we have nearly doubled earnings over the last year, and have been one of the best performing industrial stocks in 2017. Through the acquisition of Faster Group we'll further strengthen our competitive position which allows us to continuously create value. Here we pretty much show a summary of the strategic as well as the financial benefits."
1,"I'll just add. I mean, I like the question because that's how we look at it as well, that ALXN1210 is a significant opportunity. And maybe the best way to respond is we look at the speed of enrollment from John's group in both the Switch trial as well as the NaÃ¯ve trial as a proxy for what the potential of the product could be."
1,I'll now go through each of these areas in more detail. We've said many times that AIA is exceptionally well positioned to make the most of the significant opportunities in the Asia Pacific region. The 28% increase in VONB we delivered in 2017 demonstrates the benefit of AIA's broad portfolio of growth markets and our absolute focus on the region without distraction or dilution.
1,"I'll speak about this later. But while it impacted us in the quarter, we're evolving to this change in the business and we see opportunities. Operating margin in Branded Apparel was 7."
1,"I'm going to ask Andrew Wilson to talk about it in a second, but we have obviously indicated palliative and chemo. I think there is significant opportunity across a range of areas. But we're being very thoughtful at running pilots to make sure that these do benefit our customers, they are clinically strongly supported and they are getting the strong support of doctors."
1,"I'm going to continue to give you guys updates every quarter on progress we're making. But we think it represents a significant opportunity, but there's a lot of work to be done on it. So, thanks for the question."
1,"I'm happy to report that in February 2018, we completed the implementation of an integrated IT sales platform and now all websites that you operate are running with a more robust, multi-device comparable, agile and fast paced platform. This platform will allow us to adapt faster to the constant changes in our customer behavior, and also to deploy several initiatives during the next quarters to increase dynamics and granularity in how we price for different products and shipping charges as well as   and how we best attract and retain our customers. Delivery is a key component to customers' acquisition and loyalty."
1,"I'm happy to report that the team is executing the integration plan and we are doing well relative to the business case. Additionally, the BDI Pharma business we acquired last quarter is a solid complement to our existing plasma offerings that allows us to expand plasma and biologics distribution into specialty pharmacy and home care with differentiated expertise. We're also pleased with the progress on integrating this transaction."
1,"I'm not going to get into details of what each one of those represent. The areas that were on the slide that talked about science structures and others is where we're going to focus, and I think that to Steve's point earlier, we're not going to serve that $11 billion of market, but we also know that that's   it's a thought process now that allows us to look at the full value chain within each one of those areas and identify where there's real value for us and where there's value for our shareholders and then go out and attack them."
1,"I'm not saying we're going to have a sales force restructuring. I believe that the commercial model that we have in place is being   is one that allows us to leverage good relationships in what we define as prowess of the organization we currently have. What I'm saying is we have an opportunity to specialize, to add additional reps that would concentrate in areas that we don't directly concentrate on today."
1,"I'm talking about genetics, I'm talking about devices or also talking about diagnostics. So, we see opportunities that were integrating a much more comprehensive portfolio. Definitely we already are in some of these end markets."
1,"I'm very confident we will do that. And as I've talked about previously, I think there's a significant opportunity here because it is a big market and a lot of the new drugs that are coming on stream are going to be more hospital based and pharmacy based. So, I think it's a very logical place for us to play."
1,I'm very excited about taking on the additional responsibilities here at Kush Bottles. There are numerous significant opportunities. It's an exciting time to be part of this company and part of this sector.
1,"I'm very pleased with the way the Mitel team has integrated and is executing. We are now one company, a market leader focused on delivering the best experience possible to our customers, and we have a sustainable business model in place that allows us to make significant investments in innovation that will continue to differentiate Mitel from the competition and keep us well-ahead of the market as it continues to evolve. I will now turn the call over to Steve to review our financials for the quarter."
1,"Importantly, we do not expect this to impact our strong credit ratings. In addition, you should note that the scope of the deal size allows us to retain flexibility to pursue other value-creating opportunities. On timing, the transaction has been approved by both Boards of Directors and we expect to close within the next three months."
1,"Importantly, we expect to accelerate product introduction by leveraging existing Blue Hat registrations required for sales in China. The investment and strategic partnership are a testament to the strength of the GNC brand, CITIC and Harbin's confidence in our business plan and the significant opportunity we have together in China. Importantly, the partnership strengthens our balance sheet and financial flexibility and provides us with an exciting new platform for growth."
1,"Importantly, working with BP, the interpretation and integration of these data will enable us to refine our understanding of how the petroleum systems work, as well as providing calibration of our 3D seismic and its derivative products. This will allow us to explain the exploration outcomes and observations to date and should enhance our predictive exploration capability going forward. Furthermore, these studies are enabling us to redefine the plays and rebuild our lead prospects inventory."
1,"Imprimis is a pharmaceutical company with a simple mission, to make innovative medicines affordable and accessible in the United States. We own over 60-drug formulation patents and patents pending, and we have a flexible business model that allows us to sell our drug formulations either as compounded drugs or as candidates for traditional FDA approval through one of our subsidiary or spin out companies. Our business model is also uniquely efficient because we do not rely on middle parties, insurance companies, benefit managers, wholesalers or distributors."
1,"Improvements in supply helped the 2017 performance for this group with sales for Established Pharmaceuticals down 5%, after a 3% drag from divestments. We will continue to rationalize these products where we see opportunities to deliver value. Growth in 2018 will continue to be impacted by some of the divestments made in 2017, as well as some expected in 2018."
1,"In 20 years ago or 15 years ago or 10 years ago, that would be much more challenging. Now, we have information systems on LennoxPROs online that allows us to sort of project that information out to counter people. So someone walks-in ask a question, they could go online and quickly pull up the answer, provide information to the technician about what they need."
1,"In 2016, we penetrated 18 new customer fabs with Purion and drove the highest revenue and operating profit in 10 years. Solid cash generation in a year further strengthened our balance sheet, which allows us to continue to make critical investments to grow the business. We are now focused on 2018 and beyond, share gain and improving gross margins are our top priorities."
1,"In 2017, we also partnered with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana to form Healthy Blue, which currently serves approximately 240,000 Medicaid members. Looking ahead, we see opportunities to continue to leverage our deep expertise in Medicaid to form new partnerships and alliances with our Blue colleagues, providers and other health plans to expand our presence and reach into new markets. In Medicare, we continue to see substantial growth opportunities as approximately 11, 000 baby boomers age into Medicare eligible population every day."
1,"In 2017, we did over 25 discrete different procedures over in Europe. So, it just shows the versatility of Senhance where our CE is a fairly broad CE market, general surgery, GYN, neurology and thoracic, so it allows us to experience a lot of different types of anatomy. And so, I think while we continue to expand our indications, it really just allows more access to the market."
1,"In 2017, we expanded our quantitative and multi-asset platforms as well as our distribution capabilities globally. We see opportunities for growth in both Asset Management and Financial Advisory and we have been stepping up our investments in people, technology, and new initiatives accordingly. We are investing in the development and promotion of our outstanding performers, strategic hiring, enhanced services for clients, thought leadership initiatives, and the ongoing evolution of our work processes and environment."
1,"In 2017, we were very successful with our funding agreement issuance, receiving a positive reception and a strong secondary performance which we expect to carry into 2018. Funding agreements represent a very efficient source of liabilities, and we feel confident in our long-term potential in this market. In pension risk transfer, there is a robust pipeline of deals coming to market, and we are actively engaged in the diligence process."
1,"In 2018, we anticipate the initial rollout phase of our new point-of-sale system across the Tractor Supply chain that will integrate with our mobile POS. The new POS will allow us to improve the customer experience at check-out, integrate our e-commerce order management system and leverage customer data to ensure a seamless shopping experience across all channels. We will continue to roll-out stockyard, which allows our team members and customers to leverage our digital assets and extend online assortments while they're in the store."
1,"In addition to driving increased profitability in 2018, we're also focused on continuing to drive significant working capital improvements and strong positive cash flow. We see significant opportunity to drive additional efficiency in working capital through tighter management of inventory and improved turns. Given the seasonality of our business and need to reduce our level of connected inventory, working capital benefits are expected to accelerate as we move through the year."
1,"In addition to our $250 million revolving credit facility, we have two untapped $100 million private placement shelf agreements. We are not reliant on the equity markets to achieve our targeted 2018 acquisition volume and this prudent approach to leverage allows us to be opportunistic while making capital raising and capital allocation decisions. The company paid a dividend of $0."
1,"In addition to Taiwan, we now have Northlanders residing in a number of international locations including Hamburg, Amsterdam, Mexico City, and London, as well as of course in Toronto. Global decarbonization efforts offer significant opportunities for Northland. Government policy changes and incentives are driving a rise in renewables and coal retirement targets across the EU, Canada, the U."
1,"In addition, a dedicated compounding pharmacy relationship team is now in place with a goal of establishing effective relationships and growing our current BIO-IGNITE program. We believe this is a critical and unrecognized vertical that contains significant opportunity for both TX-004HR and TX-001HR. This channel is unique to TXMD and we believe our differentiated approach represents a significant opportunity for our company."
1,"In addition, a significant future driver of value for our business is our unique ability to mine our own portfolio. This solid base and our principle around new business allows us to be very selective as changing markets present new opportunities. Reassuringly, we have excellent visibility of future earnings through a combination of our AUD 2."
1,"In addition, based on our current estimates, we expect that over the next four-and-a-half years through fiscal year 2022 the recent tax legislation will reduce our cash taxes by approximately $90 million to $100 million dollars. The cash savings represents a significant opportunity to increase our investment with particular emphasis on targeted core growth areas including additive manufacturing, and our soft magnetic solutions portfolio, which Tony will discuss in a few moments. Our capital expenditures for this fiscal year are planned to increase from $120 million to $135 million with the increase being equivalent to the fiscal year 2018 cash tax savings."
1,"In addition, don't forget the upcoming impact of the operational effectiveness and efficiency program. This will allow us to compete with twin advantages on efficient cost base and highly-skilled profitable underwriting. We're very pleased with the outcome of the 1/1 renewal season for reinsurance."
1,"In addition, noninterest expense in 2017 was reduced from $199 million to $155 million, a 22% reduction. The current run rate allows us to selectively invest in new initiatives and opportunities. We are now in the third phase of our organizational design process."
1,"In addition, our financial restructuring business was named by IFR as the financial restructuring advisor of the year. As we enter 2018, we are optimistic about the business climate that we face and the significant opportunities that exist for our firm. We believe that tax reform will be a net positive for our clients and for our business."
1,"In addition, this spring, we are opening a 400,000 square foot facility in San Bernardino, California, that will be dedicated to TBR tires. Both warehouses will allow us to more efficiently consolidate and distribute products directly to customers as well as supply regional distribution centers, improving fill rates and shortening customer lead times. With regard to our TBR business, we continue to outpace the U."
1,"In addition, we continue to gain traction in cross-selling rail, terminal and road services. Finally, we see opportunities for further cost reductions and operating efficiencies. Overall the UK business climate is good and our focus is on operational execution."
1,"In addition, we continue to make progress on our vendor partnerships that allow us to test new categories and expand our offering online without increasing our inventory investment. We believe these partnerships will allow us to engage new customers online and drive traffic to our stores. Our 2018 priorities are focused on three areas."
1,"In addition, we do not anticipate being a cash tax payer this year. In closing, the anticipated growth of our operating cash flow following the American acquisition allows us to fund the reinvestment of our existing portfolio, reduce leverage and preserve liquidity to pursue new strategic opportunities that can further enhance shareholder value. That concludes our prepared remarks."
1,"In addition, we expect the cash flows from the loan portfolio to generate between $400 million and $500 million for the next 12 months, along with approximately $130 million to $140 million of investment securities cash flow during the same time period, all of which would be able to be invested at higher rates. This continued to give us significant opportunity and flexibility as we move over to 2018. During the quarter, we did have $5 million of securities which matured at a yield of approximately 1%."
1,"In addition, we started to unlock value below the operating profit, a result of the progress made in our capital structure and after having achieved investment grade status with both Fitch and S&P during the year. This is a promising development and allows us to be eligible for the main investment grade indices in the U. S."
1,"In addition, we're updating and improving our suite of branded fare products. These fares will allow us to further segment our customer base and offer a variety of fare options in a customized onboard experience. Again, this investment is projected to provide annual incremental benefit of at least CAD 20 million."
1,"In all of these markets, the demand for drugs and pharmaceuticals will continue to expand, and certainly, specialty and other products are coming to the marketplace. We also have a retail footprint in Europe, and that retail footprint, directly owned by McKesson or through franchise, gives us direct access to the patient in that day-to-day interaction that allows us to build value. So, from a global sourcing perspective, from an intellectual perspective, from a market opportunity perspective, that European acquisition has been hitting on all cylinders."
1,"In both cases though, we love the prospects of what's going on in Continental Europe, and so we're excited about our growth. I think in   we had talked earlier about margins and I think throughout Continental Europe we see opportunity for margin improvement."
1,"In Business Solutions and bill payments, we are implementing new go-to-market strategies, continuing to leverage our digital platforms, maximizing digital self-service, making additional tech enhancements, and driving operating efficiencies. We believe our unique platform also allows us to serve additional cross-border payment opportunities. Now, as we look to 2018, our financial outlook reflects our expectations for a stable environment."
1,"In calendar 2017, we've acquired 19 companies. And the thought process is always to acquire something that allows us to either accelerate our product road maps, filling a gap in our portfolio, providing a new experience to customers. So it's always the customer experience in mind, right, that we make acquisitions."
1,"In closing, as we prepare to combine our companies, we are all increasingly confident that our original target of $350 million of cost synergies within two years of closing the deal will prove to be very conservative. We are extremely optimistic about this powerful combination, which will allow us to accelerate the transformation of our business, drive free cash flow and ultimately generate significant long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you again for your time this morning, and now David and I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have."
1,"In conjunction with our outsourcing organization continuum, we have the ability to source marketing collaterals geographically, deliver to our network of strategically located warehouses and distribute it very cost effectively across the country on an as-needed basis. From a logistics perspective, our scale allows us to offer our customers significant savings with minimal risk. A great example of this, and Tom touched on this earlier, is our reverse logistics offering."
1,"In customer experience and employee productivity, we have seen improvements through our digital self-service channels with the introduction of Codi, our artificial intelligence based virtual assistant. This allows us to respond more quickly to customer queries and supports a big shift of interactions with customers to digital and self-service tools. Codi now handles prepaid, postpaid, entertainment applications and general Telstra enquiries, and will be extended as it continues to develop."
1,"In December, Ecopetrol obtained the OHSAS 18001 Certification in Occupational Health and Safety, as well as the ISO 14001 Certification in Environmental Management. This actually allows us to continue to ratify our high standards in health, safety and the environment, expands our competitiveness as we continue to align ourselves with the best practices around the world. I will now pass the floor to HÃ©ctor Manosalva who will comment about the operational results for the year."
1,"In emerging markets, we will push for an acceleration of our expansion. Finally, the performance of our segments and a controlled CapEx will allow us to increase significantly cash from operations over 2017. We finish here the full-year 2017 results presentation."
1,"In emerging markets, we're adding more commercial resources to expand our presence. This allows us to grow our customer base and seek insights for future innovation areas. And with that, I'll hand over to Tina."
1,"In entertainment, Sky and Comcast have premium studios and networks that attract the largest audiences in their markets. The companies' top franchise and IP of global appeal, creating significant opportunity to distribute content across Sky and NBCUniversal properties. Sky News and NBC News are two of the most respected news organizations in the world."

The companies' top franchises and IP have global appeal, creating significant opportunity to distribute content across Sky and NBCUniversal properties. Sky News and NBC News are two of the most respected news organizations in the world."
1,"In fact, we have the opportunity to upsize the offering but chose not to. The $450 million allows us to develop our assets with a secure source of capital for many years to come, without liquidity concerns, while also giving us the flexibility to focus on paying down our debt over time. Now turning to our 2018 plans."
1,"In general, we do have quite an active   proactive M&A agenda, and we are continuously looking at several potential acquisition targets. We see opportunities for doing acquisitions across all of the three divisions, and both in areas such as products, channels, and potentially technology as well. So, we're obviously   in terms of sort of innovative core technologies, we are looking very carefully at sort of new competitors that are popping up."
1,"In late 2017, we started to demonstrate progress in key areas. Continuing the momentum will allow us to overcome the near-term headwinds and lay the foundation for success. In the future, the demographics will become a tremendous tailwind for the industry."
1,"In Life, we expect earnings of $16 million to $18 million which is largely flat to 2017 due to a modest increase in mortality costs. We continue to see the Life segment as an area of significant opportunity and plan to continue to grow the business in the double-digits. The tax reform changes clearly have favorable impacts going forward."
1,"In line with the current strategy of KPIT not to go after these customers, that's what we are   we do not have a go-to-market strategy for those verticals. Now, that is what will get   will be added or will be complementary from this merger, which will allow us to grow in that part. The second thing as we've talked about was the consulting capabilities which will also allow and bring a very good business mix between ERP and the non-ERP revenues."
1,"In metro, we had 12 customers for our new 16QAM XTM II as of the end of Q4. While relatively small from a revenue standpoint today, early reception of XTM II is positive, and we see opportunities to meaningfully grow its revenue in the coming quarters. From a customer vertical perspective, ICPs, who were the first adopters of ICE4 products, were the biggest growth driver in Q4, with two large customers deploying CX2 and XT-3300 platforms."
1,"In order to be more relevant to younger customers, we realize the need to adjust our messaging and change the way we communicate with them. The mobile app and loyalty program I mentioned a minute ago will allow us to engage with this group more effectively and allow them to more effectively engage with us. Additionally, we're expanding our social and digital marketing efforts and now have around 14% of our total system marketing budget deployed against digital marketing efforts."
1,"In order to deliver profits to our shareholders, we want to lower cost income ratio and we can manage   and we have to manage both the cost base and the income base. We see significant opportunities on the revenue side. We have been capturing them this year."
1,"In parallel, we have improved once more, our operating margin and delivered a net profit above â‚¬2 billion, also a first in the history of the Group. This will allow us to increase our dividend, if it is approved by the shareholders at the AGM this May. Our strong cash flow generation has allowed us to reduce our net debt significantly, which, combined with net earnings, brings a further improvement in our return on capital employed."
1,"In preparation for that, we have continued our deep market assessment, while developing and executing the required clinical, regulatory and legal strategies to prepare and advance FT218 for potential NDA approval. We firmly believe there is a significant opportunity for a large group of eligible patients that need and deserve an improved treatment option. Our interactions with the patients to date have helped us to uncover important needs that make us even more confident in the commercial potential of that FT218."
1,"In preparing to adopt a new accounting standard required for all companies in the first quarter of this year, we are proactively implementing new systems to centralize and enhance our view of accounts receivable. This allows us to be more precise in our evaluation and resulted in a change in an accounting estimate during the quarter. This change did not impact our 2017 operating performance and has no impact on our 2018 guidance."
1,"In recognition of the importance of China, I'm pleased to tell you that in December, we filed a clinical trial application or CTA, which is the equivalent of an IND, for bema in China. We believe this will allow us to expedite enrollment in our FIGHT trial. To further help us capture this market, accelerate our pivotal trial, and significantly lower our global development costs, we recently announced a strategic collaboration with Zai Lab in Greater China."
1,"In setting our long-term aspirational goal, we've improved margins annually and delivered 350 basis points of operating margin improvement using 2014 constant currency, inclusive of heightened investments to drive future growth and in the midst of migrating our customers to the cloud. We see opportunity ahead to further improve profitability through infrastructure optimization, continued focus on operational excellence and execution against our internal productivity initiatives. For example, we're underway executing a cohesive workplace strategy to better align our organizational objectives with our geographically diverse workforce, which numbers roughly 3,000 in total."
1,"In some cases our development work is taking us literally off the chart as can be seen with one of our new developmental press hardened steels which are shown in the blue boxes. Some of these   these are next-generations of hot stamped steel grades which will allow us to continue to progress in that segment of our business. Obviously we have stronger steel that can be   that can form more difficult parts than ever before, it opens up new opportunities to reduce the gauge or thickness of the part."
1,"In summary, 2017 was a very good year for Steve Madden as we delivered strong financial results and also made important investments for the future. We entered the new year with strong momentum in our flagship brand, increasing traction in our international business and significant opportunity with some of our newer brands. Based on that and the business model over the last few years has proven its resilience in the face of a challenging retail environment."
1,"In summary, in 2017, we reported solid results while aggressively transitioning our offerings to focus on the more rapidly growing cloud apps and digital transformation opportunity. More importantly, we believe the investments we are making in our Digital Transformation Platform, our expanded cloud application and RPA capabilities, our IP-as-a-Service offering, and alliances will allow us to continue to drive structural growth. As always, let me thank our associates for their tireless efforts and as always, urged them to stay highly focused on our clients, our people, and the exciting opportunities available to our organization."
1,"In summary, SPS is the largest retail platform to enable fully orchestrated retailing across all channels, a platform architected for today's complex omnichannel environment, which includes brick-and-mortar, e-commerce and drop-ship. We have a multi-billion dollar global opportunity in front of us, and we feel confident in our momentum exiting 2017. With that, I'll turn it over to Kim to discuss our financial results."
1,"In summary, the groundwork for a larger yet simpler American Midstream began in 2016. And as we continue through 2018, we've had a partnership with more focus and scale in our core operating areas and an asset footprint that allows us to capture meaningful growth opportunities. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lynn."
1,"In summary, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from growth as we continuously improve our business through the Bison Way. This will allow us to sustain our high cash generating platform and invest in a range of value enhancing opportunities, including stock buybacks and high return capital investments. I feel positive on the direction we are heading and look forward to the upcoming year."
1,"In terms of balance sheet impact, pro forma net leverage would be 3 times immediately after closing. Our strong balance sheet allows us to take advantage of attractive opportunities like this transaction, and maintaining balance sheet strength will continue to be an important priority for us. Our previously announced capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, including the 2018 capital expenditure guidance we outlined for both Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal on our fourth quarter earnings call."
1,"In terms of fleet, during 2017, we took delivery of two Boeing 737-800s and returned one Embraer-190, ending the year with 100 aircraft, one more than at the end of 2016. We also continued working on several important projects that should contribute significantly to our results over the next couple of years including upgrading our reservation system, currently in user testing, which will enable us to make the most of new ancillary revenue opportunities, migrating to a new unified MRO solution, which was successfully completed in October and will allow us to more efficiently manage our maintenance programs for both the Boeing and Embraer fleets, resulting in lower cost; and a company-wide project over the last two years that achieved more than $40 million in annual savings. On the operational front, we've delivered an on-time performance of 86."
1,"In terms of our path to 1% or ultimately 3% share, if you look at our approach to opening these states versus how we opened the Midwestern states in the early to mid-90s   you've heard us talk about our goal of getting to about 25% agency share of the markets that we're in overtime and our current or legacy footprint is only at 18% at this point which varies from one state to another, but 18% overall. For the most part, we've opened up these new states in and around that 20% to 25% range, which would indicate that we least have access to available premium that will allow us to ramp up our market share more quickly than we have in other expansions or in our in our other legacy space. But that said, we focused our company on underwriting and pricing discipline, and I realize that's a little bit of a statement that may lead you to question, hey, are we going to commit to a timeframe?"
1,"In terms of the growth, Brian, what our presentation today, of course, is all about the growth. We'll hear about our expertise we have and in particular, how that expertise allows us to grow into adjacent areas and grow our businesses. So, hopefully, after today's presentation, hearing from the group heads where the growth is taking place, you'll have a much greater feeling in terms of what the opportunities are for Macquarie in these three areas."
1,in that transaction. And so that's why it allows us to potentially price the product more aggressively and also maintain similar kinds of margins.
1,"In the ball category, we're introducing an entire new line of Chrome Soft Golf Balls, all featuring a new and larger Graphene infused core. Graphene is a Nobel Prize winning material, which in our application allows us to make our balls faster than ever before while maintaining their soft feel. Its use in this manner is proprietary, and we're really excited about the feedback we're receiving both on tour and in consumer testing."
1,"In the case   for example, our software really enables us to better   because of our better data reduction, it gives us better cost advantage in almost every case. Another example is because we're multisource able to take advantage of different types of NAND at different times very quickly, it allows us to take advantage of price discontinuities in the market between different types of NAND. And then finally, I would say lower Flash pricing in the industry will open up more market for us."
1,"In the case of international banking, insurance has the potential to double earnings in the medium term. Currently, penetration rates are very low and there is a significant opportunity to leverage our distribution channels to capture the untapped potential of the bancassurance business. For context, in Latin America, creditor insurance is mandatory and non-creditor products can also be offered in our channels."
1,"In the end, it comes down to execution and I'm working with our team to improve here. Going forward, a robust continuous improvement system across the company, using lean principles, will allow us to achieve better workforce engagement, new levels of problem-solving accuracy and velocity, process control and quality of delivered product. Our goal is to be the industry leader and sustain that leadership with continuous improvement."
1,"In the first quarter of 2018, we completed the small but strategic acquisition of SchrÃ¶der. In addition to solidifying our position in the marinating and injection portion of the protein value chain, we see significant opportunities for SchrÃ¶der in Asia. While total revenues from completed acquisitions put us ahead of pace on our Elevate journey, we have a robust pipeline and financing capacity to continue JBT's successful acquisition program."
1,"In the first quarter, we do not plan to open any new pharmacies, and we'll continue to monitor the sales performance of the existing stores. Currently, we see opportunities for the development of the pharmacy project in synergy with the drogerie reformat. Loyalty cards."
1,"In the first quarter, we expect sales to be lower year-on-year due to higher distributor inventories at year-end 2017, particularly in the Wood segment. Separately, while the new laminate license model, which Don discussed earlier, will negatively impact full year on the top line by around 1% of total sales and margin benefit is quite positive, we anticipate that our focus on growing categories, product innovation, and strengthened distribution partnerships will allow us to accelerate sales in the second half, which should more than offset the Q1 sales decline and the lower sales from the new laminate licensing model. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 32% to 33% in 2018."
1,"In the IT Services business, we will continue the integration with OnX, while strengthening our recurring product base across our North American platform. We are confident that our increased operational scale will allow us to win larger deals across diversified customer base, while continuing to shift our product mix from non-recurring product sales to recurring services. We are confident in the road ahead, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver long-term value for our shareholders."
1,"In the past 12 months, we've brought even more discipline to this lever, increasing shareholder returns, while maintaining alignment with our growth strategy. We've recognized the opportunity to reduce our overall asset intensity by monetizing certain high value properties and using the proceeds to both underwrite new growth investments and return capital to shareholders, while still maintaining a substantial balance sheet that allows us to continue fueling the growth of our brands through ongoing asset recycling. As you know, we announced last quarter our intent to sell $1."
1,"In the Permian, microseismic data is giving us insights into how completions intensity and reservoir geo-mechanics impact fracture geometry. Our latest advance completion design concentrates the frac energy close to the wellbore, which increases stimulated rock volume and allows us to more effectively drain the reservoir. In the Montney, we've seen how changes in fluid system have allowed us to place our sand using 40% less water."
1,"In the same way with the ITA product in Smart Orchestration, yes. Smart Orchestration allows us to do a couple of things. One, it allows us to better target the right people faster to remediate an incident when a system outage happens, but Smart Orchestration also allows us to almost automate the response, to draw up a workflow and use certain rules to take an action when something is down, like actually restarting a server because it qualifies that this has happened three times before and in this type of event, you don't risk any of your infrastructure by restarting the server."
1,"In the second half of 2018, we look forward to providing more mature data from the disease-specific combination expansion cohort as well as initial data on the MDSC high combination expansion cohort with clinical and translational data, including insight from paired tumor biopsies. To ensure that we deliver on a significant opportunity before us with IPI-549, we are continuing to attract great experienced talent to support our efforts. We recently announced that David Beier is joining our Board of Directors."
1,"In the short-term, Domain Point provides us the opportunity to move rents to market rates as well as the flexibility to accommodate our existing and prospective tenants increasing space needs while we continue to build out the Domain under extremely tight leasing conditions. We also have the potential to expand or redevelop the site which could yield an additional 1 million square feet of office space expanding our already significant opportunity to redevelop key sites within the Domain and furthering the Domain status as Austin's second downtown. We acquired Domain Point in a joint venture in which we own an approximate 96."
1,"In the third quarter of 2018, the premium prepayment of these notes decreases and we have opportunities to refinance the notes, which could provide estimated annual cash interest savings of $10 million to $15 million. As we continue to optimize our capital structure and operating leverage, we expect our generation of cash flow to improve, which will allow us to further reduce our leverage in the next couple of years. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Ruben for some closing remarks."
1,"Increased costs in different parts of the world are discouraging new capacity addition and are also placing a floor on the prices of our products going forward. Some producers are switching overcapacity from one product to another, but our unique position in this industry allows us to take advantage of this trend by optimizing our production portfolio across the different product families. Next slide, please."
1,"India is a market in which the government is actively working towards demonetization and building a modern, digital economy, and we view India as a strong and compelling opportunity for PayPal. With well more than a billion digital consumers and a thriving online merchant community, deepening our engagement in China and India will continue to be a priority for PayPal in 2018, and we believe these markets offer significant opportunities to drive substantial scale. I'd also like to comment on our relationship with eBay."
1,"Industrial investments in our Rice business are expected to be completed by the first half of the year. This will contribute to enhanced margins, as it will allow us to improve rice processing and distribution, while, at the same time, increase the value of our main byproducts. Finally, as for investments in our Crops business, we expect to complete the construction of one of the two storage and conditioning facilities by the end of the year."
1,"Inventory risk maybe shared with the partner as well. This will allow us to take advantage of opportunity in which sales volumes don't support the cost structure of a fully licensed model, but whether it's still an attractive business opportunity. This refined strategy will optimize profitability allowing for a greater number of locations while achieving our target of 10% to 15% for each one."
1,"It accurately predicts and then delivers guaranteed advertising schedules for our clients, removing the need for make goods and giving Nine a significant competitive advantage. Our technology allows us to maximize the return of our ratings in real time and significantly improves the utilization of our off-peak and our multi-channel inventory. It's been a great half for Nine."
1,"It allows for good continued investment in the business. And it allows us to improve financial flexibility, reduce debt and increase the dividend."
1,"It also includes the benefits of putting the two supply chain networks together and leveraging Albertsons' extensive food manufacturing capabilities across the Rite Aid business. Lastly, we have identified the benefits of combined purchasing   pharmacy purchasing and branded grocery and GM/HBC buying, as well as, a substantial private label benefit, which are all very significant opportunities for the combined business. We are confident about our ability to achieve these synergies not only because of the extensive collaborative work that's gone into identifying them, but also because the Albertsons' team has a proven track record of achieving synergies."
1,"It comes online more middle of the year of 2018. But that allows us to take our great customer base and move into kind of specialty sweetener blends which we think are really great for the South Korea market. So, we're kind of   that's moving and progressing forward."
1,"It drives our growth, helps our life growth, and our profits. And third, increasing scale allows us to drive better negotiations and pricing discussions with manufacturers. It also provides us market pricing information in our own negotiations as we look through the negotiations with other payers, and this drives profit."
1,"It enables efficient sequencing of the CFTR gene and cystic fibrosis. A distribution agreement with the University of Zurich allows us to offer histoCAT software for multi-parameter tissue analysis in conjunction with the Hyperion Imaging System. We obtained the rights to globally distribute histoCAT, which identifies or enables researchers to identify unique cellular social networks across a range of disease states."
1,"It gets AM a seat at the table for any future projects. AM strategy is to be involved if it meets our rate of returns in every project from a midstream perspective, where AR's molecules flow, it gives us a lot of confidence and the throughput allows us to de-risk that investment, and it's a great business model, and it's worked very well for AM, and it should work well in this 5-year plan that we're going to review here."
1,"It gives us a window into what new oncology drugs the leading, most innovative pharma and biotech companies are developing. And it allows us to partner with those innovators as we discover and test new biomarkers to help them with their drug development programs. These advances will also help fuel growth in our Clinical Division as those drugs are approved and put into clinical practice."
1,"It gives us better retention of these customers and it allows these customers to serve their own basic payment needs, right? They can still talk to a salesperson if they want to, but they can serve their own basic payment needs and that allows us to free up sales resources to be able to focus on larger value customers. And so, we think there's some good growth opportunities in the B2B business."
1,"It implies not only significant learning, we think that our understanding of this technology has advanced and grown a gap in between us and the rest of the industry, but as we talk about a cadence of technology of every two years, being able to achieve our targeted yields in a reasonable period of time becomes not interesting, but it becomes mandatory. And I think that we are getting our own internal proof points that not only can we deliver the technology in a two-year cadence, but we can do it in such a fashion that the yields will allow us to make a superior margin."
1,"It is a fun, free experience for families to enjoy together. It demonstrates that Tractor Supply supports what our customers care about, and allows us to make an emotional and direct connection with them. This year, our Fair Tour will support 24 state and county fairs across the United States delivering millions of impressions."
1,"It is also important to reiterate that we strongly believe that this change serve as a significant competitive advantage for Silicom which has been able to long demonstrate its unique capability to generate high net profits, while offering customers attractive and innovative products with low gross margins. We believe that such a capability presents a significant barrier for competitors and will allow us to better capitalize on the many opportunities in the market and the overall effect to our bottom line will be very positive. In fact, we can already show this effect, comparing our 2017 results to those of 2016."
1,It is not an MVNO agreement. It is basically   it gives us access at highly preferred rates to their infrastructure and it allows us to have a second proof point. We've always been very bold that we believe in fixed wireless convergence in the future and this is just another proof point that we want to make sure that we can prove to ourselves and prove to the market that a combination of our wireless spectrum combined with cable infrastructure is a winning combination in the U.
1,"It is our intention to maintain relatively low leverage, access to multiple capital sources and well-laddered debt maturities. From time-to-time, we expect that we will uncover meaningful opportunities to expand and grow our warehouse network, and we will maintain our balance sheet in such a manner that allows us to act on these opportunities. On March 15, 2018, our Board of Trustees declared a pro rata dividend of $0."
1,"It is the scale and strength of our platform that enables us to absorb the initial costs of these additions, while positioning our business for continuing profitable growth in the years ahead. As I mentioned, there remain significant opportunities to increase the reach and penetration of our higher-margin value-added products and our expansion initiatives are delivering results in terms of above market growth. Our 2017 investments included opening four new truss plants and productivity enhancement at 20 existing plants."
1,"It leverages our vast range of provider relationships. It leverages our bespoke aggregation engines to match users to the right field for them and it leverages our new platform, in particular the API service layer that allows us to serve price comparison in other places, not just on our own site. So super exciting, early partnerships and discussion, and we hope to share more with you on this as we go through 2018, again directly linked to the KPIs that we're disclosing around active users and marketing margin."
1,"It obviously improves our competitive position within that space. And we think, over time, it will allow us to extend the model outside of the historical Avendra focus, which was really the hotel hospitality space, into other channels. So maybe just for everybody because I do think to your point, Kevin, this maybe isn't space that's well understood."
1,"It obviously is centered in our backyard and as we know, supply side response to fuel that incremental demand is quite muted at the moment. I think that's quite a challenge for our industry as a whole to make sure that we got a regulatory framework that allows us to capture some of the benefit of this expected demand while being able bring on new projects in a responsible manner. But same demand in our key markets is obviously growing substantially as well."
1,"It offsets some of our training costs as well. When we look at it, we look at When we look at it, we look at it as a solution really to our customers, labor solution and to ourselves, and it allows us to train and facilitate our training and get people deployed faster and also when they hit the ground, you know, people today, kids today, we need to put them out there smarter. And so that they're able to be smarter when they hit the ground and I think  piece of this and it allows us to really complement our already trade associations and things that we're doing today and work in a collaborative effort with our client and our trade associations to deploy more people and grow organically faster and more economical."
1,"It provides our customers with knowledge and industry expertise along with market insights which they tell us, they value and trust. This drives deeper customer engagement and increase our mix of differentiated products and ingredients which allows us to deliver and capture more value. Our commercial teams are delivering and our customers are responding."
1,"it really allows us to optimize the physician financial performance and work hand-in-hand with our customers on allowing them to increase their market reach; it fits with our go-to-market strategy, meaning we can offer this platform on a modular basis, we can offer it as part of our operating partnership; and then strategically, it really allows our customers, by extending the MSO platform to the affiliated physicians, it allows our customers to have visibility and better alignment across that affiliated physician network to better manage patient lives. So, all in all, this MSO platform very, very strategic for our customers and it enables a new growth channel and, in essence, increases our value prop to the customers on a going forward basis."
1,It was around the   is it market expansion that allows us to get to 1 million.
1,"It was developed by Dick Swanson back in the 1980s, a Professor at Stanford. What this does is it allows us to expose more of the cell to the sun, which allows us to capture more photons, obviously, highest efficiency, but it's a unique technology. It's more of a semiconductor-based technology."
1,"It was just that this particular year included a lot of smaller transactions that got us into key overlap markets, but didn't include some of those bulkier acquisitions that can drive the value up. We feel confident that our return to normal will occur in 2018 and that that pipeline that is existing currently will support strong performance so that, really, over the cumulative period we'll be comfortable with the outcome."
1,"It will allow customers to use the same account and funds whether they're gambling online or in club. It will allow us to give benefits and incentives in both and to reward loyalty, things that digital-only operators can't offer. We'll start rolling out our single account and wallet product now named Grosvenor One in Q4."
1,"It will be in place for the flu season of next year. Now those assays aren't huge drivers, but again what that does is it allows us to have an extended menu, a different chemistry, which allow us to partner with third parties as well to PCR-based chemistry as you know. And then it also has an open channel, which will allow lab-developed test and esoteric test to be put on the system as well."
1,"It will have a frozen and a chilled chamber. And that, of course, then allows us to extend the roll out of that frozen and chilled proposition across our stores in the Midlands and indeed the South as well."
1,"It would be predicated on what the growth opportunities are. I mean, we certainly have the ability to run the company more profitably, but we want to have a balance between where we see opportunities to accelerate growth and where we see margin. So profitable growth is probably the way to look at it right now."
1,"It's a big piece of China-Southeast Asia where we are today. I think that our new structure as an organization where we can work across the organization allows us to stay in those businesses but don't emphasize the incremental investment going to them. When they were standalone businesses, they spent the same rate as percentage of sales in R&D and same on selling and marketing."
1,"It's a significant opportunity in EMEA, where prices really   consumers are very price sensitive. There's a   we've tested lower price GoPros in EMEA."
1,"It's a technology that we've been working on for several years. I think, it also represents a significant opportunity to displace the plastic injection molding conventional techniques. And so, we're still working on that development process and the systems related to that."
1,"It's a terrible thing to say about such a terrible natural disaster as a hurricane. But what a hurricane allows us to do is fully demonstrate the range of our capabilities and be that our technical capabilities, our logistical capabilities, or the range of fleet that we have. So, you see the hurricane activity typically goes to non-construction customers."
1,"It's a very good question. We do make a portion of resid, particularly in Anacortes and Alaska, and the acquisition of the distribution system allows us to go to the ultimate end customer. So, like I said in the comments, we believe one of the benefits is, is that we can build upon the business and have pretty significant growth over time, which is why we started today to prepare for 2020."
1,"It's about building amazing experiences in products that have people want to come back. If you think about where   with the flywheel we have today is largely based on a voucher product, there's a truckload of friction which isn't great, yet we still have a flywheel that works and allows us to invest in significant scale. So, building the brand, building amazing products and experiences, and expanding our overall marketplace footprint and aggregating massive merchant scale in our platform all start to contribute to that, what we believe can be a much more powerful flywheel that allows us to invest disproportionately in growth and in growing customer wallet share."
1,"It's about the rails of our business and we think we are three or four years away on some of these things. But we think it's for real and that will allow us to be more aggressive in terms of managing our balance sheet, managing our product shelf and some other things. So, blockchain is for real and we're in a variety of different consortiums but we're also doing some of our own work on it, Darko."
1,"It's allowing us to process a lot more transactions at a lower cost than we've done before. From a retail viewpoint, we'll hear shortly from the team, it actually allows us to create products we just couldn't do before, not only we're going to be delivering better products to clients, but we couldn't even reach the clients before. So, it's a very exciting story in terms of how technology will impact on us."
1,"It's been a great partnership already. But this will allow us to prove that we can do even more complex, larger projects in the short timeline. So that's really exciting for us."
1,"It's been a one-size-fits-all kind of product offering. As you move through this year, we're going to be making enhancements to our website, that's going to allow us to do better merchandising, as well as the launch of our mobile app last year has allowed us   we just went to market with some basic functionality and will be coming out as this year progresses with more functionality that will allow us to think about merchandising and push notification. And just a lot of things that makes us operate more like an e-commerce business and think about how we are in the digital age and how our customers want to be communicated with and how they want to receive offers."
1,"It's both. We all see and we all feel the impact of what's going on in the industry and the disruption to our respective businesses, but we also see both in Legg Mason and with our affiliates, significant opportunities to improve and to drive greater growth and profitability. And Pete will talk a little bit about this."
1,"It's early days. If China really restructure the aluminium business, then that could create significant opportunities for us. So, what we want is to being option-ready that if we're absolutely comfortable that there is a market there then we can trigger those options."
1,"It's global and we assume there will be also benefit for the Faster products to get sold via these channel partners. We want to accelerate the expansion into the growing international markets, predominantly in the emerging markets and obviously from a revenue perspective we see opportunities here to enhance the Hydraulics and Electronics solution capabilities that we have. From a cost synergy perspective, it will grant us access to some of the suppliers in Europe."
1,"It's going to really enhance functionality around checkout. It's going to allow us to maximize delivery opportunities, so checkout, it will allow us to accommodate many more payment methods than we accommodate today for instance. As great as our online experience is, we think it could be even better really maximizing personalization, really taking individual customer data, digging into it and really doing much more suggestive selling."
1,"It's great for us. It allows us to really kind of flex our muscles in technology, leveraging our Tc-SAW capability, our in-house gallium arsenide, our switching, our packaging in Mexicali, all of that. So we're seeing share gains in an evolving set of products that maybe two or three generations ago have grown up to be more and more rich in content, richer in value."
1,"It's growing at 6% and it really highlights channel blurring. Tyson already plays in large deli categories like rotisserie chicken and deli meats, and combining this with new positions from recent acquisitions really allows us to lead in deli-prepared foods with a new dedicated team. For example, we're taking the fresh bread baking capabilities from AdvancePierre with the recipes of Original Philly to deliver authentic cheesesteak experience without the labor for deli operators."
1,"It's important to note, that digital transformation and clinical evolution are not mutually exclusive. We see opportunities that will require expertise in both. For example, telehealth is an area where MAXIMUS could further infuse digital technologies into our core clinical assessment and occupational health offerings."
1,"It's just it's   there's just more risk and it's a harder lift. And so it's kind of natural for   the larger the insurer, the more natural that is to say let's take an experimental step, not just a proof of concept but something that creates some value or allows us to go into a new market and let's see that that destination makes sense and works and that you   Guidewire know what you're doing there. And then we have a conversation about the core book of business."
1,It's occurred in the first two months. We've got clear plans to sustain that in existing reserves base and we believe there's significant opportunity to add value from the infill and the tie-back opportunities literally that was sort of no real exploration done for around 15 years. So Brian and the team are anxious to get their arms around that.
1,"It's on a modern programming language, Node. js, which allows us to have a vast population of capable engineers that are able to then build on that platform. So we expected that the benefits would be a significant improvement in engineering capabilities or I should say engineering really efficiency and we've seen that."
1,"It's probably more a 2019 growth driver than an 2018 growth driver, but early days and early indications are very positive. In addition, Fusion, which is a sidecar to our Panther system, allows us to have PCR-based capability as well as open channel capabilities on the molecular platform. And where that's really important is not only to expand our   continue to expand our menu across the globe, but the open channel is certainly unique as we work with our partners in the labs to help them provide lab-developed tests, as well as working with third-party developers to expand their menu faster."
1,"It's taking longer than we would have liked. And we still see the significant opportunity on DFI that we saw, let's say, a year and a quarter ago when we had that Analyst Day. I think the positive part has been, we believe in a larger opportunity on Exensio than we saw even at that time."
1,"It's the reason that we focused so heavily on a quality of service metric on the collection lines of business. We see opportunity in churn whether it's on a revenue basis, as I mentioned, or on a number of customer locations like we've historically measured churn, there's continued opportunity. We haven't put a number to it and it's not a guidance topic that we're going to give you a guidance number on, but we're going to seek improvement every year in that metric."
1,"It's unclear how long that is going to take. So, it's clearly a significant opportunity. You can see that either by the size of the domestic bond market, some of the stats I gave you around CCXI's rating portfolio."
1,"It's where we have the ability to tap into capabilities that are market-tested, that are proven, that allow us to enhance our core client proposition. The best way to do it is a method that gets us to market quickly and that allows us to incorporate new capabilities into the existing suite of services. We have fundamentally a relationship-based banking model, which means we focus on serving our clients across their broad set of financial services needs, whether that is financing for capital expansion, risk management and an area where we have been quite focused in building out our commercial insurance capabilities, core payments processing, capital markets or otherwise."
1,"It's worth mentioning that in 2018, we are launching a big data project with Microsoft to improve our analysis and business intelligence capabilities. This partnership will allow us to better understand our clients, their needs, and expectations in order to further personalize the shopping experience and our relationship with the brand. Finally, from a communication perspective, we have significantly improved our digital presence for all brands."
1,"It's year, couple of years of reinvestments in new product development and we're coming out with products that are winning. And so, we feel confident that hopefully we can continue to accelerate our share gains. And when we look at orders, last year, orders were 7."
1,"I've mentioned before that we are transforming our main end-to-end processes and making them much easier for customers. This remains one of our most significant opportunities in the bank. Despite growing in the mortgage market over the last few years, we recognize that our customer experience should be significantly better than it is today."
1,"I've spent the past six weeks visiting our stores and offices around the world and have been very impressed with the selling culture in our stores and how customer-focused our frontline associates are. It's clear to me that there is a significant opportunity to build upon our solid foundation to realize the full potential of our business. At Saks Fifth Avenue and Hudson's Bay, the team has spent a lot of time and effort to create an exciting shopping experience that capitalizes on our positioning in the luxury market and in Canada."
1,"James will review it in greater detail, but I'm really excited about the opportunities for Hain as we go from an effective tax rate of 30% to a much lower rate in the mid-20%s. This will provide a significant opportunity to use these savings to fuel incremental investments into our brands to grow the top-line, to drive awareness and household penetration, as well to invest in our people and infrastructure, which we've already started. Over the last 25 years, we've created an incredible company at Hain Celestial."
1,"Jive's high-velocity inside sales motion and their SME customer focus is highly complementary to LogMeIn's proven go-to-market motion. And combined, we believe that there is significant opportunity for cross-sell to both customer bases. Longer-term, we'll look to leverage our combined global R&D operations to integrate Jive's modern technology platform with LogMeIn's leading meeting, video and chat services to create a real-time web-based collaboration platform that we believe will be unique and disruptive."
1,"Just by regions, outlook, if you will, I mean, we talked about the Americas. September was going to be a tough quarter, we feel confident coming out of December quarter in the Americas, and we think that's going to continue. As Bill pointed out, the positive book-to-bill, backlog is growing, and we're gaining just more customer and supplier confidence here at home in the Americas."
1,"Just to give you an example, our nearest competitor has 60 components in a USB charger, we have 24. The reason we can do that is we have developed technology that not only allows us to integrate the high-voltage side, which has always been our focus in the past, but now, also the low-voltage side, this is the user side where the complexity is coming from USB-PD. So, it's allowing it to add more content in our chip."
1,"Keep in mind that that goal of working capital as a percent of sales to be less than 20% was a goal that we set in the fourth quarter of 2015 on the heels of the Power Solutions acquisition. And one of the things that we knew was that, as we integrated that business into ours that we did have significant opportunities for working capital improvement, partially through process, partially through incentivizing with the right goals for the right groups of people, et cetera. And so what we realized over, I would say 2016 was I'll say the low hanging fruit coming off the heels of that acquisition."
1,"Keep in mind, Travis talked about some of the opportunities in Pop Health, so some of that VA will also flow into the Pop Health bucket. So it will feed more than one line, but at principle feeding will be in the core business, which allows us to grow that. So the VA is a key element of driving that."
1,L5 brings a streaming video-class Internet experience to Business Aviation and we saw a significant increase in sales with the introduction of this new system. Our new Business Aviation products will allow us to further expand the markets we serve. Our global Ku-band tail-mount system will launch later this year and will serve the large jet market with market leading performance.
1,"Last but not least, when we are getting into the new dynamics of the industry, which is completely unknown right now, and I am not guiding to that but I'm just saying that the level of entropy, the level of dynamics is increasing when you talk about T-Mobile going into video through Layer3 and then DISH going into mobility, Charter and Comcast going to the mobility strategy and you have many other components. And on top of all that, the new acquisition will allow us to get and participate in the entertainment and media space and all of the above are converging. So this level of dynamics is good for business."
1,"Last quarter, we foreshadowed starting a new building, Owen said we hit the goal at 20 CityPoint and we have active interest for the remainder of that building. As we said at our investor conference, the most significant opportunities for high contribution occupancy improvement is in our New York City portfolio. At 399 Park, we are in active discussions with a tenant that could take the entire low rise block, 250,000 square feet and we have an active pipeline of tenants of between 65,000 square feet to 150,000 square feet for the low rise space if that deal doesn't happen and a number of tenants for high rise floors."
1,"Lastly in the Asia-Pacific region, we will leverage our existing placements to help build a pipeline and opportunistically pursue deals. We view Asia-Pacific as a significant opportunity for TransEnterix in the future, both due to the relative large population size as well as the fact that many countries in this region tend to be early adopters of medical technology, specifically robotics. As I will discuss shortly, we're pursuing a number of regulatory approvals in key countries which will open these markets for future growth."
1,"Lastly, in May of 2017, Medicare coverage from Percepta became effective through the multi-X program, making the test available to nearly 60 million Medicare recipients. And finally, the modification of the CMS 14-day rule, which removed challenging billing requirements for institutional clients and will allow us to fully manage the billing process going forward, greatly streamlines the sales process coming in to 2018. Our third measurement of success is evidenced development."
1,"Lastly, more compact size, and high brightness images for use indoors or outdoors. This gives Vuzix, we believe, a substantial advantage over other competitors, because it allows us to produce optics that are fully transparent, even when they're off. Think about it, how many folks put their sunglasses on, take them off and are constantly cleaning them, because they don't like the smudge they have to look through."
1,"Lastly, on digital pure players. This is the fastest growing part of our e-commerce presence, and it allows us to attract younger consumers into the brand. We're partnering closely with our pure play customers on marketing events, optimizing search and other data analysis to drive higher traffic and conversion for our brands."
1,"Lastly, the telecom industry is embracing the idea of shared fiber infrastructure, including now through innovative sale-leaseback transactions. Our announcement today of a sale-leaseback transaction of our fiber network that will allow us to lease fiber to TPx as our anchor customer and eventually to other carriers is further proof that existing fiber can be more efficiently owned in a shared infrastructure model. I will have more details to share on the TPx transaction later in this call."
1,"Lastly, we continue to position our specialties business for long-term growth. First, we completed the expansion projects for both our Royal Purple and TruFuel facilities last quarter, which will allow us to keep up with customers' growing demand for those high-margin products. Second, we're looking forward to continued growth across all of the new products that were introduced in 2017."
1,"Lastly, we operate one of the most flexible retail models in the world. This allows us to target a wide variety of shoppers across different geographies and demographics and react rapidly to changing market trends. We believe all these elements make TJX's business extremely difficult to replicate."
1,"Lastly, we will build on the success of our strategic Nordstrom relationship by targeting exclusive wholesale partnerships in new markets where we can drive volume and leverage our rich brand equity. This will allow us to improve our brand awareness globally in a cost-effective and impactful manner. Next, our customer."
1,"Later this year, we hope to get approval for the PAD   CAD indication that will be very unique to us. That represents a significant opportunity for us to continue to grow and regain share. In addition to that, in China, Apixaban is not applied for submitted for staff due to the clinical data issues that they have there."
1,Let me conclude by stating that this acquisition plays to the strengths of Primoris. It allows us to use our strong balance sheet to make an attractively priced strategic acquisition and to use our experience in integrating acquisitions to grow these new businesses both in revenues and profitability. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for any questions.
1,"Let me conclude today's call by saying I'm very pleased with our 2017 accomplishments and performance. We have many significant opportunities and milestone in 2018, including growing our in-line business, successfully launching Soliris in gMG, raising the standard of care and extending our leadership in complement with ALXN1210, advancing and rebuilding a leading rare disease pipeline, and delivering on our financial ambitions. By focusing on these areas, I'm confident that we can achieve sustainable growth and create long-term shareholder value."
1,"Let me give you an example and we'll tie it back to technology here for a second. So in Search, as we referenced, we've moved to a new assessment model, we've trained everybody globally, we're wrapping it with some technology as well which will allow us to standardize the search assessment model, and therefore be able to drive margin improvement through standardization. So there is some place where we're investing our capital to be able to drive margin improvement as an example, which I think will be quite sustained as well."
1,"Let me take that. So, I think when you look at overall our analytics penetration, I think the company still has significant opportunity to not only add analytics capabilities into some of our traditional relationships, but also increase analytics penetration, analytics solutions into some of the clients that we do support today from an analytics perspective. Now, as Keshav mentioned, we have over 50 clients today where we have some component of analytics, whether that's on a project basis, whether that's on a dedicated center basis as you mentioned or on an embedded basis."
1,"Let me try to get through the different parts of your question in terms of the landscape, and I'll go back to where I started, I think, again in my remarks. And then I think we have significant opportunity for growth across all of our businesses. And as I think about the competitive landscape, I think we're actually fairly well-positioned."
1,"Like I said, we've started approving those. We will accelerate the approval of those projects as the engineering gets done and as we again see an opportunity where the plant downtime allows us to install those facilities. If you look at it at total, my guess is that, we will accomplish two-thirds of them this year and may be one-third next year."
1,"Lis's extensive experience in operations and FMCG businesses has been invaluable to the group as we assess transformational change opportunities to better service our customers, determine what we make and where we make it, and drive the bottom line. We still have some way to go in this assessment, yet, we feel confident there are pathways for change which can significantly enhance our business effectiveness and reduce cost. We will continue to update you on our progress."
1,"Listen when we have less cars that allows Brian Barr to have 14 less mechanical facilities with less people repairing less cars. It allows us to have less car hire, the money that we pay for other railroads cars being on our railroad. It allows our customers to have less to merge driven by the fact that their cars are in our yards and we can't get into their facilities."
1,"Looking ahead on slide 13, the combination with Bayer will allow our two companies to accelerate the pace of innovation through our complementary skills and shared vision. Our R&D team is excited and energized by the new areas of scientific advancement we expect to unlock by combining with Bayer, which will allow us to bring more new products to farmers faster. Thank you."
1,"Looking at slide 22 and the increased use of big data capabilities, we are also progressively rolling out our big data platform. The use of big data allows us to enter into better   into better targeted campaigns but it also allows better targeted investments in the network as I explained earlier with the 10% for example, but also improved channel management as well as an increased effectiveness of revenue assurance and for detection. Turning to slide 23, part of our digital transformation and our drive towards innovation."
1,"Looking forward, our business model remains strong. We have diversified in a way that we believe allows us to grow, regardless of short-term challenges, whether it's a channel shift in the U. S."
1,"Looking forward, we are maintaining our strategic growth targets for our product categories, with IoT targeted at 20% organic growth, Infrastructure at 10% growth and Broadcast and Access each at a 10% decline. We believe our product mix will allow us to deliver gross margins between 58% and 60%. For full-year 2018, as we have previously discussed, we expect to operate toward the lower end of our target model operating margin range of 20% to 25%, with OpEx growth dictated by revenue performance."
1,"Lumber is doing kind of what we would expect to seasonally, albeit a little bit more drastic this time of year than last year, but we do expect that to tail out here probably by Easter or so and follow its typical seasonal patterns. So, we feel confident that we're going to be able to continue to offset any kind of commodity-driven price increases in other categories."
1,"Major initiatives started in 2017 that will benefit us in 2018 and beyond. As Matt   as we mentioned, and Connie mentioned, our new credit facility with Bank of America provides increased flexibility and support for our global operations and allows us to consider specific strategic acquisitions. We're making major operational investments in automation, equipment, and expanding our footprint in Mexico as mentioned by Matt."
1,"Management contracts are a great way to expand. It allows us to grow faster with less capital and gives us the opportunity to increase our presence in other islands with less risk. It increases brand awareness, and it allows for increased market and showing economies of scale."
1,"Many of these efforts were described and discussed during our Analyst Day last July, and we are very excited to have put those plans into action in these recent busy months. The increased level of investment across each of these areas will allow us to execute a successful launch and fully support our global expansion efforts. As you know, our study was global."
1,"Margins for the year reflect the impact of higher land, labor, and material costs particularly lumber and concrete, partially offset by higher selling prices. Consistent with comments we have made previously, we see opportunities to realize additional overhead leverage as our volume grows. As a result, we expect 2018 SG&A to be in the range of 11% to 11."
1,"market could very easily match or surpass what we're seeing in the global market. And so, we feel confident with the   putting the right time and being careful with our resources, we'll be able to realize that. So, there's an opportunity here and it will allow us to again bridge into the pharmaceutical."
1,"markets. We see opportunities in a number of metropolitan cities, whether they be Nashville, or Austin or Houston, to name a few. But the order backlog currently is concentrated in the markets we're in."
1,"Massive MIMO has two advantage for us. One is that it helps us to improve 4G, and as we're using what we call a split-mode in Massive MIMO, it will allow us to introduce smoothly 5G, meaning that as soon as 5G and our software will be available probably by the end of the year, we'll be able from a software point of view just to switch on to 5G our Massive MIMO sites. So, which means that our intent is to have a 5G   a national 5G network in first half of 2019, so which is ideal because we'll have the network, handsets will come there."
1,"Mastercard can now be a big part of that. And what it allows us to do is look at all sorts of payment flows and say what's the best rail, what's the best tool to do it, and it really massively expands the universe that we can serve. So very, very excited about the work we're doing with Voca."
1,"Matt, I'll add a   or sorry, Ron, I'll add a couple things to that. We are investing in sales right now because we see opportunity out there to continue to improve the dialogue with advertisers. We have such a different conversation with them now, whether it's an upfront conversation or otherwise than we had a year ago given the improved ad format, given the improved audience and engagement and the better ROI that our salespeople are able to talk to advertisers about."
1,"Maximal has achieved success in the utility and standard segments in this region and in certain export markets. This acquisition will allow us to start reaching this expanded customer base and more effectively meet our customers' needs by broadening our product offerings of utility and standard products, expanding our low-cost global manufacturing capabilities to bring the design and production of our UTILEV product in-house, and increase our participation in both the China market, as well as in the growing global utility and standard market segments through a local and global distribution network. This joint venture is also especially important for strengthening our current China operations, which are operating on a scale below the level needed for long-term success."
1,"Meanwhile, we are now preparing our new program for 2019 and are very excited for its launch. We feel confident in the team's ability to do what needs to be done to return Nutrisystem to goals. Now, let's discuss the South Beach Diet, which as I mentioned earlier is growing fast."
1,"More content leads to more licensing opportunities, more licensing opportunities lead us to more properties for us to produce against, which in turn leads to a broader consumer base. With today's consumer being influenced by a continuous stream of new content, our fast fashion approach to business allows us to attract new consumers and expand our addressable market. Our world-class supply chain can develop a new product and have it on the water as little as 70 days."
1,"More importantly, we have embedded the business with significant upside in the future. We now have substantial businesses in North and South America, Europe and Asia that will support future growth in multiple markets and will allow us to focus our investment in regions, where the risk return proposition is strongest. We also have operating expertise across hydro, wind, solar, storage and distributed generation assets and we have amassed a 7,000 megawatt development pipeline, which we expect to provide over time excellent investment opportunities at premium returns."
1,"More to come on this topic as we move through the year. We see a significant opportunity for growth in adjacencies in 2018, specifically GM Financial, where we expect to once again improve earnings. Globally, while we expect a continued increase in raw material prices, we currently expect to largely mitigate through other cost performance."
1,"Most of the remaining growth capital will be invested at Macassa, with a vast majority relating to the initial work on a new shaft at the Macassa mine, which will support growth, production goal of over 400,000 ounces within   at Macassa within five years to seven years. Turning to slide 17, as mentioned in our January 17 press release of this year, we are thinking a new shaft at Macassa that will allow us to both double production and get the mine to   and sorry double production to over 400,000 ounces over the next five years to seven years. And in fact the shaft will also provide many benefits including de-risking the mine, improving ventilation, and other working conditions, and supporting future underground exploration."
1,"Moving on to Land Operations, we'll be focused on generating cash from development units, development parcel sales, and various recapitalization strategies for both wholly-owned and joint venture projects. Federal tax reform helps us here as it will allow us to retain more of these proceeds for reinvestment in our commercial portfolio. In diversified agriculture, we're working actively with farmers, ranchers and others to convert our former plantation lands into productive uses."
1,"Moving to my second topic, I'd now like to assess the two P&L structure that we rolled out in 2017. This structure allows us to better manage costs and profit margins related to operating our solutions, acquiring new customers and building new solutions for our On Premise and On Demand cloud delivery models. Throughout the year, we also fine-tune the operations and teams within the P&Ls and restructured and re-enhanced our global sales capabilities."
1,"Moving to slide 16, the combination will also allow us to get even closer to our customers by applying enhanced data analytics capabilities to a current combined base of 25 million active loyalty program members. This will allow us to drive traffic across the combined company, market real time personal connections with our customers, drive new customer acquisition, develop new merchandising programs and generate demand forecasting. As the chart on slide 17 show, Albertsons pharmacy customers spend more than 3."
1,"MTG Studios, that is now becoming a part of the new Nordic Entertainment Group, is the leading production company in the region, and we look to further strengthen our position within especially scripted drama. And we see also significant opportunities to accelerate our digital-first production capabilities with the help of Splay Networks where we are aiming to take a leading position in content marketing and made for specific devices production development. We want to expand."
1,"MuleSoft's mission is to help organizations change and innovate faster by making it easy to connect the world's applications, data and devices, and we're solving one of the biggest problems in IT. MuleSoft is at the center of a significant opportunity to help organizations bring their digital investments together into an application network. As enterprises move their business to the cloud, deploy SaaS and embrace mobile and IoT, the challenge to quickly and efficiently deploy projects to deliver the benefits of digital transformation is massive."
1,"My pleasure to introduce the management team and leadership of Wingstop as our next presenter. Wingstop is our favorite small-cap growth idea because of the high returns that are produced at their new stores, the significant opportunity for growth domestically as well as international markets, and the opportunity to build sales at existing locations through greater awareness in some new channels. So, I'm going to leave it there and introduce you to the CEO, Charlie Morrison, and he can explain why I'm right."
1,"Nasdaq provided the company with an initial 180-day grace period for the minimum bid price requirement which concluded yesterday. We will receive a letter today which will allow us to request a second 180-day grace period from the Nasdaq panel. This is a standard process at Nasdaq, and although it will be up to the discretion of the panel, we expect to be granted an extension of the grace period for another 180 days."
1,"Nearly every scientific session included CGM data, whether it was the primary focus of the presentation or simply a measurement of the effectiveness of another device or drug therapy. Considering global penetration rates remained very, very low, we believe this environment creates a significant opportunity for DexCom to capitalize on for the next several years. And as we move to our next generation platform, we are well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity."
1,"Nish is going to start us off by discussing our revenue growth targets over the next several years. Our CFO, Ken Krause, will continue the discussion and provide more insight into the work we've done to improve productivity and to reduce our cost structure over these past years in particular, and he'll also discuss where we see opportunity to further improve this moving forward. After Ken's discussion, Nish, Ken, and I will field some questions from you."
1,"No, I appreciate that. And then just on your professional services offering, I know one of the   when you guys talked about the Unified deal, you saw some significant opportunities to potentially sell some of your professional services into those customers. How are those conversations going and do you get a sense that you might be signing up some of these customers in the coming months or into fiscal 2019?"
1,"No. What I would say is, and it's a reiteration really, there is significant opportunity for us to drive efficiency and productivity and leanness within this organization."
1,"No. Where we're seeing more activity is from lodging opportunities in Camps and so we see the low   less significant opportunities on the rental side, so we would expect in 2018 to see the proportion of lodging to rental to increase."
1,"Non-residential also remained strong as the value of office construction hit an all-time high in 2017. In addition to a $3 billion redevelopment of the Salt Lake International Airport, which will last another five years, there are other significant opportunities on the horizon including the construction of an 855,000-square-foot Amazon Fulfillment Center and approximately $600 million in public school construction funding approved by voters in November 2017. This translates into regional demand in Utah over the next three years."
1,"Notably, the manufacturing and maturing clinical profile JCAR017 suggests the potentially best-in-class therapy for lymphoma and an important addition to our existing hematology portfolio. Operationally, this acquisition allows us to accelerate Juno's pipeline and capture 100% of global economics from JCAR017 and all future products. Our ability to immediately capitalize on current and future advances in cellular immunotherapy and to add new opportunities in this dynamic field is also significantly enhanced."
1,"Now Helix allows more experimentation in that space, and so the players that I talked about are all targeting the genealogy space, and that's emerged as the first killer application in consumer genomics. What Helix allows us to do, as a market, is really test all the other markets, right, the wellness market, the nutrition market, the fitness market and see what's the next killer application in consumer genomics beyond genealogy."
1,"Now look at what the Presort footprint looks like and what opportunity that gives us. The most important point is it allows us to do a much more rapid expansion than we could have ever conceptualized without Presort being part of the team. So in 2018 and over really the next 12 to 18 months, we will expand to five new locations that you see highlighted here."
1,"Now on slide 14, we believe the market for Baxdela in scanned is large with over 3 million patients hospitalized each year and about 2 million more treated in the emergency department. In addition, there is significant opportunity in the non-hospital settings that surround the hospital, which we call peri and post-acute care. We're focused on this important specialty segment where there is an opportunity there to keep patients out of the hospital and cure their infection."
1,"Now that we have that relief, clearly, we'll continue to grow with our very profitable Foodservice business and support those strategic customers in that business as we go forward. But I think it also allows us to open up some more capacity into more of the Global segment, so we should get some of the growth back in the Global segment as we look forward, as Richland comes up and as the Hermiston line comes up. And so just as you look at balancing among the segments, clearly we got some margin push overall here in the near term, but as we bring this more capacity online, clearly that's going to impact margin, still very profitable customers, but maybe not quite as profitable on those incremental customers, those incremental pounds as we've been able to get here recently."
1,"Now that we've entered the clean meat snacking business, we're exploring several other verticals where we feel we need products, including plant-based meat to supplement space and more clean snacking brands. We're focused on these categories generally but the most significant opportunity appears to be in the supplement world, including Canada-based CBD-infused products that deliver a therapeutic benefit. As has been the case for some time, our business continues to experience a ton of forward momentum."
1,"Now that we've launched Heidrick Consulting, we can better capitalize on the market for advisory services as well. There is a significant opportunity for Heidrick enabled by our brand to take a bigger share of both markets. We've also positioned our business for growth with strategic actions, including the restructuring at the end of 2017."
1,"Now the interesting thing about Tyson and what we're designing together as a team is we have unmatched scale to deliver safe, affordable, high-quality and delicious food in a size and scale that's very rarely seen in the world. But we have to also link our design with opportunistic flexibility and responsiveness throughout our supply chain that will allow us to capture new growth and new opportunities. And when we talk about that internally, that model we're designing, we call it financial fitness."
1,"Now to slide 14, this graphic illustrates that every aspect of the combined business will complement every other aspect of the business, always with the customer at the center. The combined company will have world-class omni-channel platform, with a unique combination of formats, brands, offerings, and channels, which will allow us to meet our customers where and how they want to shop. Customers will have a wide array of ways to access their food and pharmacy needs."
1,"Now while we don't expect to be at the 35% plus gross margin levels in the near term, we have consistently been improving margins over the past two years, given efficiency programs, cost reductions, new products and our increased focus on North America and our private networks business. Gross margins for fiscal year 2018 should improve from FY 2017 levels and we see opportunities to enhance margins further in the years ahead. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $18."
1,"Now, as I look into the future and look at a more complex environment, an environment that's going to be increasingly competitive with rapidly changing technologies, I believe we have to focus the company as a focused medicines company powered by data science and digital technologies. This will allow us to allocate our capital to where our core capabilities are. We'll continue, of course, to evaluate if relevant adjacencies make sense, but we really want to focus our investment in our core."
1,"Now, as Sean mentioned, this chart shows our realized productivity performance for the last two fiscal years and for the first half of 2018. Now we use realized productivity as our metric and the reason we do this is because it allows us to look at our gross productivity, all of the savings opportunities, but we net against it real operating costs that we incur. The only three things that are not included in realized productivity are inflation, absorption and investments that we make in the business."
1,"Now, at the same time, as you mentioned, one of the more important aspects of 3D is the ability to offer conformal cooling, and that in particular has significant advantages for our metal business, as well as our general speed to market. So, that in and of itself is something that we are refocusing on and dedicating resources to, because we do believe that it allows us to be again a step ahead of our competitors. And so, for that reason, we believe that the combined package, our metallurgical expertise, the fact that we have the size, scale, multiple facilities and the like really make this an attractive opportunity and one that almost sells itself to a certain extent with our customers."
1,"Now, frequently, we're asked where we're investing and where we're disinvesting. As we complete our divesture program, this is now less about which countries we favor, as we see opportunities across all of our major markets, and it's more about capabilities. We are investing for the future by building data analytics and artificial intelligence capabilities, adding to our distribution capabilities, and expanding in Aviva Investors, bulk purchase annuities, and Global Corporate and Specialty insurance."
1,"Now, I mean, the budget is so strong. We have continuing ongoing work, and just I would just say fasten your seat belt, because there are some significant opportunities and winds that are for us going forward, that are in our Sun Belt stage, one of the California, Florida and in the Southwest."
1,"Now, it's up to them to announce when that's going to happen and how much that's going to happen, and when the time's appropriate they will certainly put that out there. But with this amount of cash generation, we do think that there's going to be significant opportunity in the future to do additional buybacks and that's going to definitely be part of our strategy going forward."
1,"Now, looking forward, the growth opportunities in the DB de-risking market are exciting. And our recent Tier 3 debt raise will allow us to target a high level of growth. In addition, we've decided to invest in our business to grow in new areas and diversify our sources of revenue."
1,"Now, one of the questions that I get a lot is, what do you do to generate this activity and how can you make sure that you're getting quality acquisitions in the future? On the left side of this page, you'll notice we have a target acquisition list and that represents approximately $1 billion of revenue that we would like to purchase into the future and we feel confident about. Now, our job in Business Development is to maintain relationships with these business owners and make sure that when the time comes they trust SCI, they are comfortable with us and that they're going to come to us."
1,"Now, we are making investments in areas that will enhance our capabilities including distribution and e-commerce initiatives. A more streamlined and linear front-end organization will allow us to better capitalize on the market opportunities for our brands and drive operational efficiencies and cost savings across the organization. In light of this new organizational structure, we expect to report under one reportable business segment going forward to reflect how we are running the business in a consolidated and optimized manner."
1,"Now, you may think I've been a little excited about this deal, but as excited as we all are here at Dana, we remain very disciplined in our capital structure. We believe we paid a fair value for this acquisition, and we will be issuing a fair amount of stock, which allows upside from the combination to accrue to all shareholders, but importantly, also allows us to drive towards an investment grade credit profile. For those of you who know us well, you'll appreciate that this is very important to me, and our entire leadership team."
1,"Number one is the increased payer coverage. We recently signed a managed care contract with CVS which will allow us to go to their downstream clients. So, while we will not have their national formulary right away, it's a start that enables us now to go to plans like Blue Shield of California and Hawaii to get AFREZZA added and continue to remove those hurdles that patients and providers face."
1,"number one, you just can't count on the weather; and number two, we have such a significant opportunity to develop our non-cold weather businesses. Ike, it's probably fair to say that we could have done more cold weather business, if we bought more upfront and earlier in the season."
1,"Oasis has worked hard to develop strong relationships with our partners on the service side, and we think that these relationships will translate into a smooth transition into the Delaware. Part of what allows us to enjoy such tight price differentials, low LOE and operational flexibilities are strategic investment in Oasis Midstream Services and our new MLP Oasis Midstream Partners, which provide gas gathering and processing, crude oil gathering, and producing fresh water services. This allows us to ensure lower operating cost and higher price realizations by providing surety of service and the ability to meet regulatory gas capture requirements and avoid production curtailment."
1,"Obviously, Arena is really at scale. And we think it's a significant opportunity for our company over the next number of years. And then Chris and his team are doing a great job in piloting it."
1,"Obviously, having a larger product portfolio with higher margins, will reduce our dependence on distribution margins and should favorably impact our business mix. Furthermore, this transaction also enables global expansion for Owens & Minor with significant opportunities for growth in new attractive markets including Canada, Japan, South Africa, and Australia. As we said last quarter, we believe the Halyard business has tremendous upside for us."
1,"Obviously, it's smaller so growing as a significant percentage for sure. We do believe that the Asian market represents a very significant opportunity, and we also believe that it's perhaps several years behind the development of the U. S."
1,"Of course, that excludes the bolt-on transaction in Alaska we announced this morning for $400 million. This is a very attractive transaction that allows us to consolidate our existing position on the Western North Slope where we have an ongoing development activity and an exciting 2018 exploration program currently underway. Even with the higher prices today, we believe it's critical to maintain discipline on our capital program."
1,"Of course. We see opportunities to test and explore paid versions of a Groupon+ product or even really using the card linking platform that we've constructed to allow people to link existing Groupon offers to a card for seamless redemption. So, there are other ways that we're exploring."
1,"Often we own a significant proportion or enlarged proportion of the manager, of those buildings as well. So, we capture the NOI growth from those buildings, not just a triple net lease income stream which allows us to hedge against inflation. And if you're in the best markets, why would you not want to take the growth opportunity that those best markets offer you?"
1,"Okay, so inflationary. And then do you see significant opportunity for O&M cost saves post-2018 at the utilities, or do you think that's kind of a normal run rate and you go from there? I'm just asking because of the heightened nuclear spend that you had in 2017."
1,"Okay. And just one last comment on your discussion on India in this exclusive licensing agreement that you have put together, it would seem like that's could be a very, very significant opportunity. The India market is definitely behind schedule in terms of approaching some of the things that you could be involved in."
1,"On the alfalfa side, we already have a distribution agreement in place with Pioneer, where we will provide them with seed production through 2024. We have made strides to expand distribution with others such as Wilbur-Ellis, but we believe there is still a significant opportunity to expand our share of the U. S."
1,"On the client side, we are exploring and embracing innovative solutions to evolve and transform our business model using machine learning, data analytics, APIs, cloud services, and open source to deliver new services. These investments will allow us to leverage our intellectual capital in more impactful ways, to evolve and be a disrupter in new and existing markets and will affect all of our businesses. From an efficiency perspective, we are automating processes and analyzing workflows, particularly in our market-making businesses."
1,"On the Medicare, we've had strong growth in our Medicare Advantage business. We recently completed the second acquisition of America's Health Choice, which gives us a very strong position here in the Florida marketplace with HealthSun and America's Health Choice, in addition to the integrated clinics, so we see opportunity in that business as well as our group Medicare business. And then, on our commercial business, again, I think we have an opportunity to grow our Commercial Business."
1,"On the next slide number 5, what we want to reconfirm is our sound capital position, the strong balance sheet, and the high Solvency II ratio, the extremely low debt leverage. And all of this together allows us to either deploy capital into new growth investments or into digital or into innovation, or if we don't find such opportunities that are attractive to the shareholders, then we have the means to carry on, for example, with share buybacks, as we have announced them for the next year, this morning. Next slide highlights the three strategic and key priorities in the group."
1,"On the one hand, MA's economics and structured finance analytics capabilities represent businesses under themselves, but in addition, we carefully select subsets of the content from those services and package them together on CreditView, with information generated by MIS. That expanded content allows us to deliver more value, which gives us upgraded opportunities and pricing flexibilities. What's more, customers who want details beyond the limited subsets that are available on CreditView, become targets for our cross-selling efforts."
1,"On the product expansion side, we're focused on getting scale in 2018. The seeds are planted in mortgage, wealth management and credit card, and we see opportunities for them to grow more meaningfully in 2018. Corporate finance, as mentioned, has been doing really well and we'd like to see continued growth while remaining disciplined on credit."
1,"On the product front, we continue to focus on our strategic products that are in high-demand categories and in line with investor needs. We're also adding products where we see opportunities. That includes our multi-asset solutions business where we're generating solid flows in our adaptive risk and diversified real return strategies in the U."
1,"On the state level, things are not quite so clear. While we see opportunities for enabling legislation in certain states, other state statutes may come under attack in 2018. We'll closely monitor the evolving state regulatory environment and this is one of the reasons why we believe bank partnerships like Elastic are so beneficial because they create regulatory diversification."
1,"On the USPI side, we're working on partnerships. So different techniques, different type of activity, but bringing that under one organization, which we're going to head up with Bill Wilcox, allows us to bring the best talent from both businesses together. So, we're looking at doing that where appropriate."
1,"On to the Cost Act, like many other companies, we're experiencing a tight labor market with upward wage pressure. We continue to expect a 2% to 3% annual increase and don't see significant opportunity to offset this with productivity improvement in the near term. With labor cost inflation continuing to update Medicare reimbursement, we will continue to feel margin pressure in the traditional Medicare fee-for-service business in 2018."
1,"One is we will shorten the go-to-market approach, how we spend resource in what territories, and the marching orders that the sales team achieves. But we will also package the product then in a way that allows us to be more, how should I say, more strategic. And with more strategic, I mean, it could be very interesting for us to enter an account with a very small product with   where the order value could be almost insignificant but where the customer over time could start using more and more of our products and where it could end up in insignificant numbers."
1,"One of our key strengths is our ability to leverage innovation, technology and control solutions across both of our business segments. This allows us to optimize our R&D investment, reallocate resources as needed and thereby better managing business cycles. Returning to Woodward level focus, Woodward continues to win in the marketplace, and as you could see in this quarter's financial results and as mentioned at our Analyst Day, we are increasing our investment in R&D."
1,"One of the immediate elements of what Ram is working on is we have been quite successful selling security attached to our ADC. And we see opportunity more and more and demand from our customers to take on some of our stand-alone security offerings that would appeal more to a SecOps buyer. And so, Ram's looking at what's the best way to capture that opportunity and which offerings should be first versus offerings that would follow on later."
1,"One of the most exciting pieces of information to give you today, we're about to complete randomization in the first pivotal Phase III LDL-C trial. As you know, our Phase III program that will allow us to get a comprehensive LDL-C reduction labeling comprises of four pivotal trials. ORION-11 being conducted in Europe and South Africa, including ASCVD and ASCVD risk equivalents patients, 1,500 of those will complete randomization probably tomorrow hitting the target of 1,500."
1,One of the things that we've evaluated in the last year is we see additional opportunities to invest in electrification. So we see opportunities to be able to enhance our product portfolio is one example of why we've chosen to do that and not take the margin up further.
1,"One of their main costs is shrinkage in fresh food. So being able to track the location, the condition of that product and putting it through a data analytics layer that allows us to understand how to inform that retailer about how to best rotate their inventory and eliminate shrinkage. We could say, along the way, it's had an escape, it's had a higher temperature and humidity condition, you need to rotate that product into your stock faster, because it's got a shorter shelf life, therefore reducing their spoilage."
1,"One of them was, obviously a diversification of revenue play and gives us some tools to go after a segment of the marketplace that we just lose to because we don't have it, so we can't maintain those cash or those assets because they just leave us. So, having a very simple and somewhat attractive custody platform allows us to maintain some of those assets that otherwise trade away from us. When you look at what we did today, we acquired a group or in the process of acquiring a group of accounts that we think can be very valuable."
1,"One thing I would add is that the additional scale that comes with this allows us to invest in capabilities, service, et cetera. So it actually takes the pressure off the price because we're able to compete in other ways."
1,"one, an innovative developmental math product this year is going in place in terms of a major pilot; and also Revel, we're going to put the Revel product line onto the platform as well. And that will allow us to innovate much faster at scale. The platform is infinitely scalable, comparable to the best digital services platforms out there in the world today."
1,"One, the customer relationship, is it an existing customer where we want to maintain a strong position with them, or is there a new customer that we're looking to gain access to with the primary output being that we get a better component and aftermarket stream as a result of that. So, we're really striving towards an installed base in a customer relationship that allows us to sell more of our components, the pumps, the valves, the dispersion equipment as well as the aftermarket spares and services that come along with that."
1,"one, there's a lot of people that want access to what we have, which is 50 million buyers in Local, a lot of data that allows us to target those buyers really effectively, and help people meet their business goals, and within that, a willing partner that will work with brands to really help them meet their needs and open up new opportunity spaces for them. So we've discovered a lot of demand for partnership in this space, and really at this point it's about being strategic with the partnership integration work that we have in front of us on the potential side to make sure that we're putting the biggest and best foot forward for our customers to give them more of what we know they want."
1,"One, with the cash in the IPO, the business is more than fully funded. And so we feel confident that we can go out and make the investments that we need to make but have plenty of cash on hand so that there aren't any actual cash flow issues in terms of what do we need to make that happen. It's really just a question of the level of investment that we make in both sales and marketing and R&D."
1,Online assortments allow us to use analytics to understand what customers are researching and buying. This data along with analytics allows us to geographically place inventory in stores based on what we are experiencing online. We recognize the in-store experience matters to our customers.
1,"OOO opportunity and the one that we will be focusing on, that we will also deploy our ad framework along with that. That allows us to monetize and that also allows merchants to be able to accept digital ads using our framework. So, while we have a thesis on that in terms of how we would like to proceed and we've made a lot of progress, we have not launched it yet and you can expect that in the first quarter of next year, we will be launching it."
1,"Or an automated insulin delivery device together with a continuous glucose monitor are doing what a healthy pancreas would, which is sensing what glucose levels are and essentially administering insulin to keep a patient in range. The 670G is a breakthrough product that allows us to get almost to that closed-loop therapy. And so what it's doing is it's basically working with the sensor to monitor the patient's glucose levels and administering insulin when glucose goes high, suspending insulin when glucose is predicted to go low, to keep a patient within 120-milligram per deciliter range."
1,"Otherwise why bother. So the opportunity is really to understand how the deployment of this technology allows us to do things differently. We went out and we did a lot of work, the biggest trial in the marketplace anywhere in the world, to understand the use cases, to understand the realities in deployment, to understand how we best set up the network to deliver the experience, but then also to focus on how we deliver great experiences in the home."
1,"Our ability to generate strong, consistent cash flows from operating activities continues as one of our fundamental business strengths. This, plus our solid balance sheet, allows us to invest in future growth opportunities, while also being well positioned to continue to return cash to shareholders. With that in mind, we are pleased to announce that we will be increasing our first quarter dividend by approximately 6%, maintaining our annual mid to upper single-digit growth profile since we initiated our dividend in 2013."
1,"Our BPX-601 program will provide the first clinical evaluation of our inducible MyD88 CD40 activation switch, what we call iMC. Our ongoing study will allow us to optimize how we use iMC to drive T cell expansion and persistence and hopefully enhanced efficacy. In our next generation of CAR-T projects, we've designed both switch technologies into the same construct."
1,"Our CFO, Joe Dwyer has been a valuable addition to the team with strong contributions in guiding the company through the critical stage of change and helping manage the day to day operations of our growing company, while playing a key role in pursuing our inorganic growth initiatives. Looking ahead, we continue to believe the business has significant opportunities to create substantial shareholder value and remain confident in our ability to draw further utilization towards our goal of achieving 100,000 surgical procedures annually by fiscal 2020. The medical device industry continues to see growing demand for better solutions and we have positioned Misonix to be the beneficiary of this environment and the many exciting opportunities before us."
1,"Our combined R&D capability will have unparalleled scale, breadth of fundamental chip technology and engineering talent. This will allow us to accelerate the development of our products and technologies that our customers want and need. For example, the transaction frees up difficult to hire R&D and manufacturing resources to develop and introduce next generation 3D sensing customer programs."
1,Our commercial team is busy gearing up. We expect our Revance product launch velocity in glabellar lines will allow us to aggressively enter and grow the $4 billion in global neuromodulator sales by generating greater adoption in Aesthetics. The team and I look forward to updating you on their progress on future calls.
1,"Our customers have beat us up because of the crisis that was in the oil industry. Both our competitors and ourselves I think are now going back to our customers and looking for relief from all the discounting that's been done, and we see opportunities to improve in that business because of that."
1,"Our development capability is the important differentiator for our business. Not only does this capability deliver quality future NOI, longer WALE, development EBIT and valuation gains, it allows us to keep our portfolio young, minimalizing maintenance CapEx and maintaining relevance in a market that is rapidly changing. Increasingly, we are seeing tenants demanding the latest smart technologies and building designs that allow great identification."
1,"Our diverse servicing staff, which offers a unique skill set that allows for efficiencies across various revenue streams, maintains product-specific knowledge and is engaged with delivering on our value proposition. And again, our recent divestiture of DCM will allow us to continue to focus on these core competencies while also driving the pursuit of additional strategic opportunities. Our fifth and final initiative is asset quality, and our results this year certainly reflect that commitment."
1,"Our efforts to improve working capital discipline are working. While I'm encouraged by our progress in this area, there's still significant opportunity and each of our business is taking the necessary steps to improve their working capital performance. Full year earnings per share were $7."
1,"Our efforts to increase AlloMap adherence will remain a key component of our growth strategy going forward, but the focus of the team understandingly having shifted a little to AlloSure, we have identified 30 transplant centers where we believe patients would benefit from additional AlloMap usage. We're also in progress to increase our field team by four individuals, which will allow us to reduce our number of territories and realize better coverage in major metropolitan areas like New York, LA and Chicago. Additionally, recall that CMS recently implemented a change to its state of service policy known as the 14-Day Rule, which became effective January 1, 2018."
1,"Our engines provide fuel cell system in a box and is applicable through last mile applications such as ground support equipment, forklift trucks and delivery vans. We're developing three basic building blocks that will allow us to address a broad base of customers and applications with limited development resources. This building block approach will allow us to continue to reiterate around a platform, making each generation of products lower cost, more efficient, more reliable and denser."
1,"Our Esterhazy K3 complex is nearing completion and we have produced the first meaningful tonnes of potash from the new facility. We expect Esterhazy to be amongst the lowest cost potash mines in the world, as over time K3 will allow us to eliminate brine management expenses. Our joint venture with Ma'aden, the Wa'ad Al Shamal Phosphate complex is ramping up production, providing us access to low cost production and advantaged access to India and other Asian markets."
1,"Our expectation for strong growth in 2018 reflects the impact of this expansion, as well as the significant increase we've noted in prescriber conviction once they see the therapeutic benefits of KRYSTEXXA in their patients. We continue to see significant opportunity to offer solutions for more patients with uncontrolled gout. Gout is a chronic inflammatory systemic disease, most commonly associated with joint pain and visible tophi."
1,"Our experienced team has generated a very competitive share of voice as we work to ensure that patients with carcinoid syndrome diarrhea have the opportunity to benefit from XERMELO. But there remains significant opportunity to increase demand, there remains a large number of oncologists who have yet to prescribe XERMELO and many others who are just getting started, underscoring this opportunity for future growth. In short, we need to continue to increase the patient base, improve the abandonment rate, decrease the discontinuation rate and increase the prescriber base."
1,"Our financial performance, with another quarter of accelerated growth and outperformance on both the top and bottom line, demonstrates our proven ability to consistently deliver upon our financial commitments and to drive growth, while investing in our business for long-term success. And as we enter 2018, we are confident that with our competitive advantages, including our portfolio of strong brands with proprietary product, our multi-channel shopping experience, our strong operating income and operating cash flow, which this year was a material tax benefit recently afforded to profitable companies like ours, has become a further expanded competitive advantage, along with our drive for continuous operational excellence and our proven track record of strong financial discipline helping to drive efficiencies across the organization, that this will allow us to continue the momentum we are seeing in our business and to deliver long-term sustainable returns for our shareholders. I would now like to open up the call for questions."
1,"Our focus on high-end consulting and engineering services has enabled us to consistently deliver strong and industry-leading financial results. Our strong and consistent cash flow generation allows us to invest in our business through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions while returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. So, just in the first four months of this fiscal year, we've closed on two strategic acquisitions; Glumac and BridgeNet, and we expect to close on our third acquisition NDY in the second quarter."
1,"Our forward-looking statements around location expansion doesn't require to be a Walmart. We have 40 retail partners with 60,000 locations, and we need less than 2% of those locations that make sense, and we balance available locations across all banners and discussions that we are having, we feel confident that those are available. Walmart is a great partner, and we have nothing with them in places as they're going to guarantee us the next 1,000 locations, but they're very excited about things that generate top line revenue for them, things that are paying better returns on empty retail space in their stores and other people."
1,"Our fourth pillar is growth through acquisitions, which we consider an important part of Gibraltar's transformation. Our improved and more sustainable operating income allows us to consider larger targets and our executive leadership team continues to invest a large portion of time and energy in the prospecting and vetting process. But as I just referenced, we have the luxury of only making an acquisition if it's the right one that will contribute long-term sustainable value to Gibraltar and its shareholders."
1,"Our fundamental strategy remains of being clear focus on the top 11 brands and top 500 SKUs, which is our core portfolio for the future growth and 93% of our sales today. This focus will allow us to continue to drive cost and complexity out of our business, including the rationalization of overly complex and lower margin SKUs. While the U."

1,"Our goal is to capitalize on the increasing demand for solutions that protect high-value physical assets, and we expect this product will accelerate the turn of our Industrial & Infrastructure segments towards improved profitability. In our Renewable Energy & Conservation segment, our solar tracking solution is an exciting new disruptive technology that allows us to participate in a larger adjacent space relative to our fixed-tilt solutions. We closed 2017 with a handful of installation and our work continues to meet all industry expectations and standards as set out by our customers."
1,Our guidance range for capital spending has been narrowed. We're confident this level of spend will allow us to sustain and profitably grow our business. Our third priority remains a strong balance sheet.
1,"Our hope is that we'll be able to see some success with it this first year and potentially start another three-year program next year or the year following. The Population Health models and services are obviously where we see opportunity developing out of the ACO, helping hospitals with their wellness programs and just that patient engagement around that process, and making the patient population of these hospitals a little more proactive."
1,"Our iBDH is under construction with completion expected in 2019. Half of this plant will help build excess capacity in our high-purity isobutylene and MTBE plants, which will allow us to upgrade more NGLs in the higher-valued products. The other half of this capacity is committed to an investment-grade customer through a 15-year fee-based contract on a feedstock plus cost basis."
1,"Our integrated approach provides us with additional customer touch points to help ensure individuals are taking their medication and to drive increased health engagement in specialty condition management, case management and health coaching. In addition, our Specialty Pharmacy capability drives significant opportunities to improve affordability for the most complex cases, because our integrated model manages both the pharmacy and medical side of the cost. I would note that our approach here help us drive the lowest medical costs trend in the industry, again, in 2017."
1,"Our latest release was very well received. The feature set allows us to go after some of those mid-sized customers and still focus on the customers we've converted, we want to still have complete support there with those customers that have been converted, and we will focus this year on those mid-sized customers. Our salespeople have identified the targets, and those are the ones that they're currently and aggressively going after."
1,Our long-term success as a steel bar producer reflects the adaptability and flexibility of our business model. That adaptability allows us to grow from a position of strength as we enter new markets and continually move up the value chain. The bedrock of that strength is Nucor's people and the Nucor culture that remains our most valuable competitive advantage.
1,"Our market leadership in filmed entertainment, our proven track record, and the success of our OTT service, Eros Now have all been instrumental in bringing this deal together. Simply put, it allows us to double our slate with half the capital with both Reliance and Eros jointly sharing the digital rights. I cannot think of a better way to have structured a win-win partnership, which brings me to my role in the future."
1,"Our market share declined slightly to 38% in 2017. While we're disappointed with that result, we believe that our strategy will allow us to regain share in the attractive market opportunities ahead. We are participating in the Florida science adoption this year, which is now underway."
1,"Our membership has continued to increase and we've crossed over 7 million members and growing. This program allows us to capture a more complete data about our customers. It allows us to truly individualize the conversation that we are having with our customers across all channels, whether we are communicating to a backyard poultry customer through an individualized e-mail about expanding their flock, weatherizing their coop, introducing them to a new brand of feed or simply personalizing their experience around poultry interests."
1,"Our organic strategy does not rely on the competitive acquisition market dropdowns or additional equity to fund organic project backlog. Additionally, the visibility into AR's development plan allows us to generate attractive project and corporate level rates of return and provide some of the longest-dated distribution targets in the MLP space. The end result is a self-funding MLP with top-tier distribution growth and low leverage."

1,"Our other major technological change will be our new digital sports betting platform, which we intend to launch in Q2, ahead of the World Cup in June. The new platform will allow us to improve the overall competitiveness of our offering and appeal to our large base of retail sports betting customers, many of whom are already playing online with our competitors. Turning now to other notable highlights from 2017, as part of our desire to deepen our understanding of our customers, we ran over 80 research studies, reaching 43,000 customers in 2017."
1,"Our participation leverages our gold standard arrhythmia monitoring technology and a world-class project and data management of our Research division. This study is in its early stages and we are excited to see how this potentially significant opportunity develops. Additionally, last year, we made our first investment into the digital population health management market with the acquisition of Telcare."
1,"Our plan will also deliver $5 million of operating cost savings in 2018. To summarize, Connecting for Growth will allow us to have a fit for purpose structure that is built on talent and technology. It will also give us added capacity to invest in innovation, digital and talent."
1,"Our playbook is pretty straightforward over the past five years, six years, seven years on how we like to finance the debt portion of our capital stack. We have an adequately sized line of credit at $500 million, which allows us to use that as we grow, as we fund our developments, as we're opportunistic on the external growth front, allows us to utilize, say, up to half of that amount. And when we get to a critical mass, we can start to think about really one of the two likely paths that we would use to term that out and fix the rate on that debt."
1,"Our present balance sheet including working cap does include some significant offshore projects and some of them that come to my mind are delivered from Brazil to Australia as an example, so we typically of course anchor the working cap impact of long delivery time, but I think that's all in and we are absolutely capable of financing that as we've always done when we work on an offshore project. Where we see opportunities to work with a leaner balance sheet is obviously onshore and especially onshore North America, where we are working with distribution and developing innovating approach with them in order to improve the service. But there is no change there in terms of working cap."
1,"Our priority is to maximize our digital capability and capacity across multiple platforms. We see significant opportunities across the sport environment through the consolidation of media rights across major codes and the development of strategic partnerships, both locally and internationally. The opportunity to enhance fan engagement capabilities through fan-based apps and audience, targeted virtual site are just a few platforms that we'll continue to explore to become a fully integrated sports media channel."
1,"Our product portfolio will be broadened with the addition of the well-recognized Varta and Rayovac brands. Additionally, our complementary business models and global distribution will allow us to use our Global Battery Platform and Integrated Supply Chain to drive cost and operational synergies through scale, operations, and enhanced distribution. And the additional top line and free cash flow resulting from this acquisition combined with the opportunity to realize meaningful synergies will further enhance our ability to drive long-term shareholder value."
1,"Our projected development costs, net of tenant allowance are projected to be just under $5 million. We have significant opportunity for new store growth as I mentioned, targeting 10% or more unit growth per year. We estimate the North American store potential between 230 and 250 stores, which includes 20 to 40 of our new 17,000 square foot format stores."
1,"Our relationships provide for some unique opportunities that you would be atypical for most net lease REITs, including those coastal opportunities to execute on. And so, that combined with our cost of capital today, allows us to go into Secaucus, New Jersey; allows us to go into Silicon Valley. And when we see an asset that we think is compelling, our team frankly in Secaucus was on the ground in 48 hours."
1,"Our reputation as thought leaders has led us to be sought out by entrepreneurs operating in the same ecosystems. As Jill stated at Capital Markets Day back in January, we are opening the aperture to consider minority investments on a very selective basis, where we see opportunity to leverage our expertise and add value to investment opportunities that excite us. We are building a pipeline of new investment opportunities and expect to make several investments in 2018."
1,"Our Salon Emotion program already proven to increase traffic and sell out has entered a new milestone, and will be rolled out across some 25,000 salons over 2018.

Stylist/client relationships are now entering a new realm."
1,"Our scientists have identified the function of 22 bitter taste receptors, meaning they have found the specific receptors that are responsible for sending signals for bitter taste found in many food, beverage, over-the-counter and API products. Using this knowledge, we have developed a comprehensive bitter receptor profile that allows us to screen APIs to identify the specific bitter receptor associated with bitter taste of the respective API. Thus far, we have identified bitter receptors for 10 commonly used APIs, and importantly, we have promising bitter blocker leads for the majority of these APIs."
1,"Our solution can save up to two days of labor over a traditional mud bed. So we again see significant opportunity here $35 million to $55 million in incremental revenue by 2020. And then lastly and in similar fashion, we're taking advantage of our current existing leadership position in the multi-family sector with our gypsum floored floors and extending that into the commercial flooring sector, which is a much larger opportunity for us, very contractor-friendly products, lot less preparation than your traditional Portland cement-based products."
1,"Our strategy really in Northern Delaware is less about just gross acreage adds and it's more about finding acreage that fits a very specific criteria and we're going to do that through swaps and trades as well as through some small bolt-ons and we've completed some of all of the above. But really that criteria echoes just what you were addressing, Arun, which is we're looking for those synergistic adds that are going to enhance our overall working interest, that will allow us to convert non-operated to company-operated wells and will provide us more optionality to have longer laterals in the portfolio. And so we continue to work that hard, it's still very competitive in the Northern Delaware."
1,"Our strong cash position, low leverage, and anticipated cash generation from our current and near-term products of approximately $2. 5 billion over the next three years enable us to pursue significant opportunities to broaden our portfolio through corporate development activities, with a continued focus on long-lived, medically differentiated products aimed at a targeted prescriber base. At the same time, we believe that the oxybate portfolio, including the Xyrem and our low-sodium oxybate product candidates, will remain a significant contributor to our business for many years."
1,"Our success in doing so over the years has played a critical role in establishing the leadership position we have today. We believe our scope, scale, safety record and balance sheet gives us a competitive advantage in the market and allows us to provide solutions that our end markets did not have in the past. We value the collaborative relationships we have with our customers and we'll continue to partner with them as they execute their capital deployment plans."
1,"Our teams are very keen on making sure that we can get those patients into the office as quickly as possible to at least get them tested and facilitate their ability to take olaparib. So, it's significant opportunity, but I don't think either one of us is necessarily opined on exactly what that trajectory may look like."
1,"Our third strategic priority of maximizing group capabilities will deliver targeted growth, and we expect to see a Â£6 billion increase in net lending to startups, SMEs and mid-market clients, as you will hear from David in the breakout sessions, and over 1 million additional pension customers and Â£50 billion of asset growth in our open book financial planning and retirement propositions. We see a significant opportunity as UK's only integrated financial services provider to meet our customers' banking and insurance needs holistically, as you will hear in more detail from Antonio Lorenzo in another breakout session. Last but not least, transforming ways of working will focus on how we will deliver our bold transformation agenda itself."
1,"Our Topsides 4. 0 program allows us to leverage our digital capability on top of automation to be able to remotely operate that facility. And for our customers that have been able to leverage this Topsides solution, we've been able to not only reduce operating expenditures as much as $10 million per year over the course of a life of platform is quite significant, but we've also been able to, in the development of these offshore platforms, we've been able to reduce the CapEx, the capital expenditure."
1,"Our two proprietary antibody technologies are helping us to fuel our growing pipeline and provide revenue streams from collaborations. As David will describe today, we also have a very solid financial base that will allow us to continue to invest in our pipeline going forward. Put together these key building components are what will allow us to reach our vision by 2025 to have our own products that has transformed cancer treatments and we have a pipeline of knock-your-socks-off antibodies."
1,"Our understanding of e-commerce as an opportunity and with ODigMa's understanding as well in terms of being able to drive conversions will only help in terms of making this opportunity more pervasive. So, in other words, we have to build out a very interesting analytical intelligent framework that allows us to monetize on top of publishers and advertisers that we hold. The second part is that at scale it becomes even more important and interesting, we believe we are getting to that scale."
1,"Our vendors are working pretty hard to figure out other ways to shorten up that timeline and we're certainly there to help and do whatever we can. What we're doing in terms of playing defense against the possibility that there is a quicker pattern is just being more diversified in the store, and so that we're showing a range of opportunities to our customers and we believe that allows us to jump on whatever gets hot next a little more quickly. In terms of the general guidance, Mimi, let me turn it to you."
1,"Over the long term, our strong view is that innovation and investment in these core growth areas will be the next leg of margin expansion after 2020. It's going to be a critical aspect of our growth going forward and that will allow us to continue to drive operating income growth in excess of sales growth."
1,"Over the past several months, our MSR has been hedging about 30% of our agency holdings and we intend to increase that percentage over time depending on market conditions. Moreover, as Brad noted, the addition of financing for MSR in the fourth quarter allows us to continue growing our portfolio going forward to further benefit our rate strategy. Our portfolio of MSR is a distinguishing factor for Two Harbors and key component of our hedging strategy, because it allows us to generate better returns with lower risk."
1,"Over time, we expect our water-related revenue as a part of our mix to increase as we capitalize on additional meaningful revenue opportunities, given the growing demand for large water infrastructure programs. Turning to slide 10, importantly, the addition of Layne will allow us to offer a broader suite of services in more markets across the country with greater reach, particularly, throughout the Midwest. Both companies bring different strengths in terms of product, services, segment positions, and geographies."
1,"Overall, prices remain high in many sectors, and we think retaining some dry powder makes sense. At reasonable equity investment allocation, coupled with our cash inflows from our insurance and Markel Ventures operation, allows us to be in a position to respond to volatility and attractive investment opportunities on a moment's notice. We also protect our balance sheet at the same time."
1,"Overall, the positive momentum continued in 2017, and as a result, all of our different businesses posted double-digit growth rates versus last year. The investments we have made and the once we are projecting to make in order to build the commercial organization and develop our product portfolio are starting to bear fruits in 2018 and we are convinced, we are following the right strategy which will allow us to keep transforming our company while showing strong delivery in our financial targets. During 2017, our free cash flow reached â‚¬197 million on the back of the profitability increase and the control of the working capital."
1,"Overall, this transaction clearly enhances the financial profile of both Xerox and Fuji Xerox. There is a very significant synergy opportunity over time and this transaction allows us to go after both revenue growth and cost far beyond what we could do alone. Turning to capital structure and balance sheet, a preliminary high-level view of the pro forma capital structure of the combined company results in $1."
1,"Overall, we believe this diverse therapeutic area and diversified product strategy create significant long-term value by enabling the broad development of therapeutic applications made possible by the zinc finger platform. It also allows us to build valuable business franchises ourselves, such as the previously mentioned inherited metabolic disorders and the emerging ex vivo genome-edited cell therapy in non-oncology indications such as autoimmune. Very importantly for Sangamo, it is also consistent with our fundamental core values, and getting the technology out there in the right hands, which compels us to urgently develop new genomic medicines to change the lives of patients."
1,"Parts of the businesses need extremely nimble, same-day delivery and service solutions, deploying configurated demand source and e-commerce solutions, which are hard to bolt on to the existing structures. We see a significant opportunity to reset our commercial function, capitalizing on our longstanding and inherent project capabilities, whilst freeing up other channels to exploit and accelerate growth in quick-response product and service markets. Output from this review will have a significant bearing on our organizational structure and design."
1,"Postal Service, the Census Bureau and the SEC. And we see opportunity more broadly in government, in education as well as we recently moved healthcare into the public sector organization at Cornerstone. And we see a lot of upside there, particularly as we combine our healthcare product with healthcare content, which we think is a really nice play for us and will result in a lot of incremental growth, both in the near term and over the long term."
1,"PPAs, whether it's purely electric and thermal, or in the case of Toyota, it's hydrogen and electricity. And I don't see that changing, so I mean, with the ITC, that allows us to apply some more competitive price points, obviously, which would accelerate the deployment of projects. Internationally, it's primarily in Korea, and that doesn't apply there."
1,"Prescriptive maintenance model is based only on scheduling and abundant safety risks. In short, we see inefficiency and its consequences, but at the same time, we see opportunities for adding value. And this is the great starting point for us in this journey and where Transas and WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ together can make a big change to the maritime environment."
1,"Private Funds and Advisory has always been a core aspect of our business, allowing us to gain scale by leveraging third-party capital and we intend to use this strategy to proactively grow all of our business verticals going forward and to create shareholder value with efficient use of our balance sheet. A diversified platform allows us to offer institutional investors a suite of opportunities ranging from opportunistic to value-add to core-plus, which would not have been possible without first proving out these investments using our own balance sheet as we've done over the past few years. And so, as we set our sights in the target of $10 billion of AUM within the next five years, we expect third-party capital to play a meaningful role in getting us there."
1,"Probably maybe not as many procedures but strategically very important is hip fracture. It's a huge problem for the medical community, especially for the payers, and putting a protocol in place that treats those patients faster from a surgical perspective and allows us to sidestep the dementia that is so debilitating in that patient population and gets them back into their life situation faster, especially when that's a nursing home, so they don't lose their nursing home bed because they've been in the hospital for two weeks et cetera is hugely important to the marketplace. So you've got a package of orthopedic opportunities there that are both large but also strategically very important in terms of addressing medical needs in the marketplace."
1,"Productivity savings are going to be   we continue to deliver strong productivity savings. And, in fact, we've got significant opportunities around our back office that we're ramping up this year and will really be a big lift in 2019 and 2020. We really haven't seen any of the benefit from some of the volume leverage and revenue synergies that we will certainly expect to be getting with Sensus."
1,"Programmatic or automated buying technology is already a key part of our digital business, and we are bringing that capability to television buying in fiscal 2018. This will allow us to make better use of our inventory, improve revenue yield on every impression and create a more efficient process for Corus and our agency partners. We plan to introduce beta trials with the five major agencies this year."
1,"Really the big opportunity for us from an efficiency standpoint here is, it gives us global visibility to inventory. It completes the loop and I think it will allow us to manage that inventory more efficiently on a global basis. Did you have a question?"
1,"Really, we're assessing the kind of deals that are available. We still have in mind that if there's an opportunity for us to leverage a deal that allows us to get a foothold at least in the Big 5 in Europe, we would really look favorably on that as well. So we're still assessing it."
1,"RediClinic continues to be an attractive asset that can deliver low-cost care in a retail setting while giving us the opportunity to form partnerships with health systems and health plans to drive additional traffic to our stores. As we continue refining our strategy, these are the areas that represent our biggest strengths as well as our most significant opportunities. To execute this strategy, we must commit to growing as leaders and driving functional excellence throughout all levels of our organization."
1,"Regarding the question about how we expect to generate cash flow, the   we have a significant opportunity in legacy CIRCOR and working capital. So we have not managed working capital well over the last three years, as you may know, when you look at our working capital turns and inventory in particular."
1,"Remember, if you look at financial services, this is an industry that faces a challenge where almost 90% of their IT budget is focused on compliance and maintenance and keeping the lights on, which leaves very, very little room for innovation. So, think about the challenges of unleashing the power of the data through those legacy systems, that is a significant, significant opportunity. So, that business case could be applied again to every single industry."
1,"Reminder, we had looked at shifting away from international intermodal and focus more on domestic, which is more catered to the strength of our network, number one, but also from a margin point of view and from a service point of view, it fed really well into to our game plan and our strategy of selling service and not just being dependent on price. At the same time now, we see opportunities on the international intermodal side. We had lost contracts early in the transformation, and it's not really a surprise when our operating ratio was 80% and we didn't have the best service."
1,"remote mount motor; one motor; and two motor. The capabilities we now have will allow us to serve electric vehicles regardless of their architecture, as demonstrated with the 14 active programs we are now working on with various customers. Keep in mind, we don't necessarily see these programs as significant near-term revenue opportunities, rather, we are positioning Meritor for the long term, because we believe electric drivetrains will be a meaningful part of the future."
1,"Retail stores are an important part of our brand experience but given the changes in consumer shopping behaviors, reducing our store fleet to improve profitability and working capital while focusing our store teams on brand building experiences will be important. In addition to retail store closures, we're also refining our wholesale and concession distribution in certain geographies, which will help our teams focus on the most significant opportunities while also improving profitability. We also face a further top line headwind in 2018, given the Burberry and adidas license contracts which ended in December."
1,"Right now, we have a pretty well-defined capital allocation plan that has a prudent reinvestment back into our existing facilities. We feel confident that this plan directly addresses the strategies for the business, and it's contributing to the growth. So, as we move forward, and if we find opportunities to invest further, we'll look at those opportunities and communicate them back."
1,"Right, right. But do you see this as a significant opportunity which would contribute meaningfully next two, three years or you"
1,"ROE, as we told you, is consistently in the teens, we had another good year with this. The increase in efficiency in the balance sheet will allow us to maintain that high level of ROE, even while the company is growing and diversifying. In regard to regulatory relations, we have our chief regulators or the FDIC, the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the CFPB, I'm happy to say we have very good relationships with all and we have shared our forecast for the bank and with the horizon over the next three years with our key regulators both the FDIC as well as the UDFI, we're 100% transparent with them."
1,"S. , Europe and Japan, we believe there is significant opportunity if the trial is successful. The study is fully enrolled and we anticipate sharing top line results in the coming weeks."
1,"S. , so those three are significant opportunities. We're still learning and leveraging what the different capabilities will be and what kind of revenue opportunity that will be, but we've put up some fairly aggressive premium goals over the next few years that   that we believe that there's a combined, CAD 3 billion over the next few years of specialty premium."
1,"S. , we have significant opportunities in Europe, Latin America and I think you should continue to expect us to look at ways in developed countries where we can go in and leverage what now is some scale or footprint that we might have to build from."
1,"S. , we still believe there is significant opportunity. I mentioned China, we're in the early stages of launch, but I think it could be a very significant growth opportunity for us there over time."
1,"S. 26% market share, but the average is 16%, so you can understand that there are some markets where we see opportunities to enhance our presence and also not creating anti-trust issues. So this is mostly related to our core business."
1,"S. and internationally, which allows us to capitalize on our global presence. We have a world-class buying organization of more than 1,000 associates."
1,"S. and the UK will allow us to grow this part of our business substantially in the future. So, you'll see this be a growth opportunity for us."
1,"S. And we need to make sure that we have the save for our customer programs, not just for 2018 and 2019, but ongoing, save for our customer programs which will allow us to continue to manage and be competitive on price and manage our margins. So yes, we're working on save for our customer with Frans across all of our brands, and I'm optimistic that we'll be able to do that and deliver on significant cost reductions and efficiency improvements going forward."
1,"S. is a very significant opportunity for us. But right behind that is maintenance therapy, where we take those patients and explore treating them three times a week for the rest of their life and in parallel front-line therapy, where instead of waiting for them to be ineffectively treated, we go with our drug right out of the gate the moment they're diagnosed."
1,"S. market, given the build-out of the EMV infrastructure that will allow us to move the market forward and towards contactless transactions. Echoing my earlier remarks, the recent tax reform will create benefits and opportunities for our business."
1,"S. market, significant opportunity for us to improve it which was an attractive piece for us within the confines of this transaction. But the lower end would be more appropriate."
1,"S. On the back of these results and the operating momentum we continue to achieve, we feel confident that our investments in research and development will yield attractive returns. R&D is a vital part of our business particularly for a medical device company like Misonix."
1,"S. Pharmaceutical businesses under Nick Loporcaro's strong leadership, which will allow us to more closely coordinate and optimize how we provide service and solutions to our manufacturer and provider partners across the healthcare landscape. Many of you have met Nick at prior Investor Day events."
1,S. plant will allow us to expand our LVT offering and increase our business.
1,"S. portfolio of businesses, including significant opportunities to continue to add new clients in the select and middle market segments and on a targeted basis with International account segment. Second, we continue to retain, develop and attract the best talent around the world, which enables us to operate with a high-touch contemplative service orientation for the benefits of our customers and clients."
1,S. So to find markets where we could invest at a level that allows us to make similar returns or maybe better returns ideally than what we can do now in the U. S.
1,S. tax reform favorably since it will allow us to access approximately $500 million of offshore cash. We plan to take full advantage of the repatriation opportunity and anticipate leaving offshore only the cash necessary to support working capital needs and planned investments.
1,"S. We have done work that allows us to potentially expand that out to the other geographies like China and Japan. And that, obviously, is something we also need to take into consideration as these markets become increasingly important going forward also."
1,S. We remain confident and excited by the growth prospects for each of our three iconic brands and we believe our strategy of focusing on franchisee profitability and guest satisfaction will allow us to further grow system-wide sales for each of our brands over the long run. Let's now start by reviewing results for our TIM HORTONS business.
1,"Satish has already talked about our network emulation capability that allows Qualcomm and Intel to test their mobile modem chipsets, but what we're talking about here is being able to do the same for the network infrastructure to provide true solutions for the base station side of the business, and we're moving into UE or user equipment emulation, which we have not been able to address before. The unique combination of Ixia and Keysight allows us to do that with the RF and microwave ability from Keysight combining with the network and traffic generation capability of Ixia. So, to wrap up this session, what I want to do is just shift you to the future."
1,"Second question was about our positioning in the digital and in the direct channels. And that, of course, indeed allows us to have some potential to grow our customer franchise the coming years because clearly, we believe we are a leader in that front but also we believe that it will be a combination of the human aspect with the support of the digital revolution that will still continue to serve customers. So, the role of the branch network within the Belgium financial services industry will, according to Belfius, still be important."
1,"Second unit is still in the commissioning stage. The innovative system allows us to supplement natural gas with waste gases from our production process to deliver usable clean electricity and steam production back to the plant. In addition to reducing energy purchases by an estimated $4 million annually when fully operational, co-generation is expected to lower Stockton's carbon and nitrogen oxide emissions."
1,"Second, contains covenants that enable us to comfortably manage the volatility of earnings that can arise in the Australian energy market. Third, allows us to operate all our assets without the restrictive provisions of individual project financing structures for business growth projects, hence, enabling us to diversify our channels to market and better meet our customer requirements. Fourth, while more expensive than the banking market, is consistent with the costs of our existing facility and less restrictive and other options."
1,"Second, it brings opportunities to leverage growth of a new platform including Bioverativ's pipeline of rare blood disorder assets and our novel hemophilia agent, fitusiran. Third, we see opportunities to maximize the franchise through expansion in emerging markets. And lastly, we expect the deal to meet our strict financial criteria, generating immediate business EPS accretion and returns exceeding our WACC within three years."
1,"Second, our only products that monetize donations are payment processing and online social platforms. We're less than 10% penetrated into our payments TAM and have significant opportunity ahead for future penetration. Also, online giving stands at less than 10% of total donations."
1,"Second, tucatinib would expand upon our global breast cancer efforts with our earlier stage program ladiratuzumab vedotin being developed in triple-negative breast cancer. We believe that our substantial internal expertise and relationships with key breast cancer treating physicians coupled with the strong team at Cascadian will allow us to maximize the potential of tucatinib. And third, this acquisition will draw upon our deep experience in targeted therapies and underscores our focus on addressing areas of significant unmet need in cancer."
1,"Second, via adoption of advanced analytics, technology and strengthening our risk culture, we will continue to minimize reputational and regulatory risk, particularly in the crucial areas of cyber and AML. And finally, investments in digital; investments in digital and data will allow us to control costs and to improve the customer experience. In summary, as a growth enabler and as a subject-matter expert, GRM provides our business lines with a competitive advantage, the global insights."
1,"Second, we are focused on investing with discipline to expand key network capabilities and to take fiber deeper into the network. And while we invest for future growth, we have significant opportunities to increase market penetration in areas where we have enabled strong broadband capabilities and related services in recent years. Third, we know we must optimize operating and capital efficiencies while successfully integrating people, processes, and systems throughout our company."
1,"Second, we execute well. This allows us to generate significant cash. This transaction provides us the opportunity to improve performance and execute well over an expanded corrugated packaging system."
1,"Shell's depth of commercial, technical and analytical capabilities and our scale and understanding of the global hydrocarbon markets enable us to adapt and respond to a changing market and industry conditions in a highly dynamic way. This allows us to see value in crudes that others can't, which mean that we make decisions that will deliver the highest value across our integrated global system. This also enables us to effectively mitigate unplanned refining or supply events by utilizing the flexibility of the refining network, logistics facilities and optimizing around our portfolio of sales and supplies contracts."
1,"Shopping for wellness solutions, particularly across broad supplement categories, is overwhelming for most customers. And while our store health enthusiasts themselves have been benchmarked as best in the industry in helping guide and coach our customers, we have a significant opportunity to upgrade our digital tools and online offerings to mirror the in-store experience. Last week, we launched our new Vitamin Shoppe mobile app, which enhances our customer experience and ease of shopping significantly."
1,"Since 2013, we have reduced our retail store base by more than 20%, while significantly expanding our outlet store base. Outlets continue to represent a significant opportunity for the brand to generate incremental sales in a highly-productive format with minimal trade-off from our full-price stores. We grew our outlet store base by nearly 40% in 2017, and expect to grow by over 25% this year."
1,"Since 2015, our international sales volume has increased by approximately 50% and has accounted for 32% of our 2017 volumes. The new export contract will allow us to continue to develop and grow our international business. With our sponsor-owned export terminal, we will continue to have the best access to the international markets, giving us an edge over other players in the industry."
1,"So   and same on the propane side, where we've highlighted a number of opportunities to grow the business. We'll do that as we see opportunities that unfold in front of us, whether they're organic or the opportunity to put new sites in or acquire existing operators. But they, of course, depend on the pipeline of opportunities."
1,"So 2018 is the first year where we will capture all of the infusion set sales for our own patients. And then as we look forward into 2018, a few other really significant opportunities for us would be the fact that Animas has formally announced that they're exiting the market. So all of those patients, which we believe they're about 45,000 in the U."
1,"So again I want to use the word that I used earlier. I think we want to be opportunistic with our buyback and we want to be prepared to play and so as we see opportunities, we're going to jump in the market."
1,"So also to remember in this equation is that we have a strategy that we have and the way we convey and market ourselves, and are able to deliver on that strategy. It allows us to grow faster than the market in average and that's the commitment we have set to the external world to you guys, is that with the strategy we believe that we can grow faster than the market in average. And we so far that has been a very true statement if you look some years back now, so we deliver on that."
1,"So also we have now 15% sales coming from export as well. So based on that, because we're aware of geographical spread and the product spread to different sectors of the economy, we feel confident that we will grow, we will be able to maintain our growth."
1,"So anytime an HRA is involved, and we can provide that HRA, it goes in conjunction with an HSA or an FSA with one plastic, one mobile platform, one sign-on that the employee can work with in a very efficient manner. So, I think from   we'll continue to gain share and I think our announcement today will allow us to continue to gain share and become a more significant player in the HSA business. I would consider us to be kind of in the top 10, somewhere in the top 10 today and I think with what we're doing, positions us well to start to really gain share on some of the leaders."
1,"So as I think about the healthcare market, we see a really significant opportunity there. Most of the opportunity right now is really focused on locating assets, locating assets in the hospital, finding those assets, being able to get better asset utilization."
1,"So as we move through the year, we expect to be active kind of on a consistent basis. Obviously, we'll be selective if we see opportunities to step that up given the share price or market volatility, we can do that. If there's opportunities to pull back, we will do that as well."
1,"So as we work through these projects as quickly as possible, we expect the negative drag from acceleration should lessen throughout the year. The solid starts and steady performance in the newer portion of our Large Project portfolio gives our team significant opportunities to deliver operational and financial performance improvement. The market remains robust and our emphasis remains targeted to disciplined project selection, partner selection, project duration and owner dynamics, all while keenly focused on associated risk and appropriate returns."
1,"So as we're growing revenue, we're also going to be growing R&D. And the tax reform benefit will allow us to accelerate some of that work on advanced prototyping activities. It will accelerate work on productivity initiatives in our factory spaces, some of what we call our second century design and manufacturing capabilities, analytics, building out some of the vertical capabilities that we talked about earlier."
1,"So by having these transload centers, what we're able to do is take the over and aboves, pare them down and ship them to the stores that actually need the products, which should have a benefit in our seasonal inventories and make us more nimble as we move forward rather than having more clearance on the back side. The last thing I'd tell you is it also allows us to build pallets of product for our stores so that the operations of the business, when it gets to the store, can be more efficient. In the past, it would all come in and have to be sorted out."
1,"So certainly, good for you, but maybe less room for third party. Now, when you're looking at this new system and your continued development, are you thinking about oversizing it even more with the expectation that, that third party volumes can be a much more significant opportunity here?"
1,"So combining the two businesses allows us to save headquarter costs, combine their supply chain, getting problem programs fixed. Either through execution, outsourcing, or give it back to the OEM, is one way to eliminate all of the cash burn and negative margin programs in there."
1,"So for example, we forecast that 30% to 40% of our operating cash flows will be reinvested in capital projects, or used to pay down debt. Second it reduces our reliance on the availability of capital markets, and finally it allows us to focus on proper capital allocation decisions. So we're not chasing high multiple acquisitions or low return projects to extend our distribution growth one period further."
1,"So for instance today, we have many joint customers with a Shopify where we're integrated to their APIs because the supplier wants one type of orders and invoices coming through SPS Commerce, so we're integrating there. And that's a big step because I think the world, over time, will go more and more APIs, which obviously create some pretty significant opportunities for us long term."
1,"So from a penetration perspective, we see from a Dealer point of view, we're underpenetrated especially in the larger Dealer group. We see opportunity from a new car Dealer perspective and also from a Display perspective. So, from a penetration perspective, we feel there's a lot of headroom."
1,"So I mean, we're fortunate that the RNAi approach allows us to develop liver-based genetic medicines and also medicines for larger diseases. We just look a little bit behind in terms of what's coming, we don't guide on this, but we have cemdisiran for complement-mediated diseases, we have the partnership with Vir around HPV, we have an alpha antitrypsin medicine that's moving forward to an IND/CTA."
1,"So I think that is probably   we certainly   our original estimates did think   we did have a growth, a steady growth in that space. So I think what the VA does is it actually allows us to say, hey, this core business can actually have a decent growth perspective because I think the way the VA likely will flow as the past quarters are issued and the projects ramp up will create a nice sequential growth year-over-year-over-year of revenue that I think does help us get to a place where our core business is growing. In 2025, it's probably growing still single digits but it's still growing, and that's a significant change from relative to what we would have had in line before."
1,"So I think that's all part of what I would consider our capital allocation framework. And I think to the extent that we see opportunities to grow businesses at the right return on equity, I think we'll look to do that. Otherwise, we'll distribute that capital back to shareholders."
1,"So I think we feel comfortable that 2018/2019, we're going to see an acceleration in those newer products. And we feel confident that we're going to continue to see reasonably healthy growth in the core Rave products. So we're not going to see a drop-off in that business."
1,"So I think we've got a de facto standard for software defined networking. Why that matters, that will allow us to do things in 5G that will make that happen faster and cheaper than they would otherwise, as an example."
1,"So I think, for them, it was non-core. For us, we see significant opportunities in those markets to drive growth and to just bring those back to   from what has been a flat profile through to a growing profile going forward."
1,"So if you look at the development capability, it has sort of to some extent been endorsed by some of these developed markets as well as major emerging market approvals. At this point in time, the Sandoz collaboration allows us to, as we said, participate in a bigger share of the risk and hence partake of a bigger share of the profit. That's one element."
1,"So if you look at the Total System Solution; it's really a co-created combination of software, services, hardware working together to meet that client's goal and grow revenue. In the end by working together with all of the companies that we've acquired over the years and the tens of thousands of products and over 100,000 customers, we figured out a process that allows us to get the most revenue synergy possible. Any questions?"
1,"So I'm really excited about the new leadership in the sales organization. As I mentioned in my opening comments, sales rep attrition has come down, which allows us to mature the sales force to become more productive. There's momentum on the sales force under the new leader which is as you realize is handling both net new sales and upsell, cross-sell and client retention."
1,"So in closing, again, we're a leader in an attractive and growing marketplace with tons of potential. We've got a very predictive and resilient business model that I think, with a loyal client base, it allows us to compete in not only good economic times, but in more difficult economic times. We continue to execute well behind our strategy, and we think the future looks bright given the compelling acquisitions that we just completed, and again we look forward to continuing to offer an attractive investment opportunity and creating long-term shareholder value."
1,"So it depends on what time of the year because I'll remind you that the town of Punta Arenas in their winter doubles their consumption of natural gas. So I think Chile gas will continue to represent the vast majority of the gas that we're going to run Chile IV on, and I think that the Argentina gas that we're hoping to contract will allow us to underpin the refurbishment of Chile I as well as additional Chile gas. So lots of moving parts."
1,"So it recognizes the great results we have in PA. Also with all that new transportation that's coming on in PA, we expect the prices to come in a little bit, give us better net back in pricing, and through redirecting existing volumes coupled with the focus, the capital there allows us to fulfill our transportation commitments. So we think those are the reasons I think we're trading below   to answer question specifically, those are the things that we're doing specifically to address them."
1,"So it's good for those patients, but it still leaves a large proportion of patients that would need other therapies, and we think Rova-T can play a significant role there. We also think that there is a significant opportunity to combine Rova-T with immuno-oncology, and we have good preclinical evidence to suggest that Rova-T when it kills cancer stem cells leads to an immunogenic cell death that exposes neoantigens. And in those same preclinical systems, we show that that synergizes with IL agents."
1,"So let me   that's a little bit on what's playing out the supply side level, a little bit about what we see from a demand side perspective. We think there are significant opportunities around both as we look forward on a three- to five-year basis. And so with that, let me do a little bit of an introduction to our new chairman and CEO, Brent Shafer."
1,"So let me remind you of what those are. I previously mentioned renal as part of our growth in 2018, and it also plays a role beyond this year in what we see as a significant opportunity for Opdivo. It's an area where we've started to make a difference in second-line and see significant growth potential in first-line now based on study CheckMate-214."
1,"So making less socks and moving upstream is probably the way we're looking at the business as we go forward. But in other areas where we see opportunity and turning to the active side, I mean that's really in our sweet spot because there you're selling at a much   even the basic products were sold at a much higher price point. So, that's an area where we really see an opportunity if   as we go forward."
1,"So now what we would like to do is turn the page and look at how within the RMS(one) platform, we're enabled to deliver new science. And what this new science allows us to do for our clients is it provides them with the ability to make better risk selection decisions, risk selection decisions with more confidence and also open up new opportunities such as the U. S."
1,"So now, we are already 20% and in the next three-year, 50% of what we sell in China will be manufactured in China. And this certainly will help cost of our product, but at the same time, lead time will allow us to reduce inventory and create a more competitive position for IMI compared to the other players that probably don't have the level of on-time delivery that we are targeting to have in the region. And then, about Bimba."
1,"So once that is done, again, I think that give us an opportunity to so-called recycle the properties, either into our private equity fund because there are other investors who are also interested in assets like these, or we can even sell outright to a third party. And to add onto this, I think through the hard work of the team on the ground, in addition to this particular site, we have acquired an adjoining site, which allows us to develop the Phase 2 of this Innov Center. So, again, this is something that we are happy with."
1,"So over the coming weeks, we'll re-evaluate how our staff will use these hours and use the stores and the partners against more customer-facing initiatives. This will allow us to do really effective product introductions and then connect with the customer effectively. So we've learned a lot in that morning daypart, and we're going to take it throughout the full day."
1,"So since this management team got together, we've done 10 bolt-ons in the last two-and-a-half years and had some good success with those. I would say they fall into   some of them are in the category of a product gap fill-in, and so a niche product gap that it's faster and more   allows us to grow faster to fill a product gap through M&A or service offering gap like we did with MMI acquisition. And in some cases, we're actually looking at consolidating competitors and buying smaller competitors, which we've done a couple of times in the last few years."
1,"So that answers the question on Somatuline. With the Cabometyx HCC in China, we're having conversations right now with China FDA to talk about a regulatory pathway for Cabometyx as you mentioned, right, there's a significant opportunity for liver cancer in the Asian markets. So we're having these conversations not only with the health authorities, but also with our partner Exelixis and even a potential IO combination."
1,"So that is key in terms of our number one focus through direct to markets going forward. Additionally from time-to-time, we'll look in terms of our hiring in group, sometimes we'll pick up small teams through overall acquisitions, but that has never been really a large particular amount of our overall investment, not saying that it wouldn't be in the future, but we've tend to find most of it from overall organic growth in an overall investment, that allows us to then still focus in terms of our capital return program for investors. We do this both with a combination of purchasing our overall shares, as well as our dividend that's been with us for many, many years."
1,So that kind of sizes up the opportunity that we're going after and there is going to clearly be some tailwinds associated with the truck. I think that's a significant opportunity for us from a profit perspective. I talked about the adjacencies.
1,"So that's a much better question than how I   what I had to do to get Medicare coverage. So, we were able to achieve Medicare coverage on the 5th of January and what that allows us to do is now to go out to the Part D plan sponsors. Those are the insurance companies that basically provide the backbone of the Medicare to the Medicare patients for the government."
1,"So that's kind of mark two. I think the last thing for us has been, as the business has accelerated, we see opportunities for taking advantage of scale and efficiency, and we think that will serve the company well and our customer base well in the future. So as volumes go up, we can convert some capital investments into operating efficiency."
1,"So that's kind of where we are. And, we think we have significant opportunity putting aside these problems to grow the e-comm business going forward. So anyway, related to the women's side, the true test is really always as we get into back-to-school, and so we are encouraged by what we've seen in market, and I would expect it to get better again as we progress into the higher volume months."
1,"So that's the dynamic. But we see clearly significant opportunity and a significant part of our business comes from expanding usage within existing customers as they start to think about new used cases, new projects and getting involved. In some cases, when customers think about the use of a technology, they'll standardize the use of the technology for a particular project, and they'll use that technology and so you know that's an expansion, that the new opportunity we'll get into participate."
1,"So that's the dynamic. But we see clearly significant opportunity and a significant part of our business comes from expanding usage within existing customers, as they start to think about new use cases, new projects, and getting involved. In some cases, when customers think about the use of a technology, they'll standardize on the use of a technology for a particular project."
1,"So that's why we're doing a strategic review because I don't want to just do deals. If we're going to have to live within our revenue stream and our financing capabilities, I want to make sure that what we're choosing to partner or divest or not invest in allows us to put the dollars we do have into the highest value accretion assets that we have. So we're trying to be ahead of the curve even before we know what would hopefully is going to ultimately look like and be as thoughtful as we can in terms of the kind of deals that we would strike or the decisions that we would make so that we continue to have the maximum value creation that we can and what's out of a very promising portfolio."
1,"So the other 85% is ahead of you. Couldn't the company grow even faster in SaaS, given that you have a significant opportunity ahead of you? And that's it for me."
1,"So the other brands that we've got in the portfolio, we expect to see them reduced. But net-net over the long term, we think that that increased focus and investment will allow us to grow our core brands at a faster rate."
1,"So the pipeline is healthier than it's ever been. We've got more conviction in our ability to successfully integrate these products, because of the strength of our UplandOne operating platform, which allows us to improve customer outcomes and also position these products for long-term and sustainable profitability. So we are very well-positioned for a strong 2018 and beyond and we look forward to building substantially more value in the years ahead."
1,"So the plan is steady and our occupancy is relatively high for the markets. But as you know, we see opportunities. We'll make adjustments, strategic adjustments to optimize the returns on a market-by-market basis."
1,"So the sale of 1% and giving day-to-day operating control to our partner isn't something that has any impact on our financial statements whatsoever. What does have an impact on our financial statements is the fact that we extended and enhanced our licensing agreement with Viacom18, and that's one of the things that not only allows us to benefit from the top line growth of the business as we accomplish the strategic objectives that I just described, but it also immediately has a material impact on Viacom International Media Networks financial performance, and that's one of the things that fuel   that's going to fuel the upside that Bob referenced in his announcement immediately in 2018 and also beyond. So it's a great transaction."
1,So this is a new formulation of ARISTADA that is   think of it as you use the nanotechnology to increase the surface area a great deal so we get very fast release from it. So it allows us to initiate treatment with a long-acting injectable immediately without waiting weeks of oral supplementation while the plasma concentrations of the LAI kick in. This is really important because about a third of these patients we reckon are   the place to initiate treatment in the hospital.
1,"So this position together with our financial strength gives us a lot of opportunities. Should the business climate go down, we still see that we can continue to grow, especially outside of Europe and where our market shares are very, very small and we see opportunities when it comes to acquisitions if prices will come down slightly again. And that is all we had planned to inform you with or to tell you."
1,"So this will ensure that lithium carbonate demand will also continue to grow regardless of the shift towards hydroxide in newer applications. This allows us to create an estimated demand for both hydroxide and carbonate in 2020 and 2025. And you can see how the rapid shift to high nickel cathodes drives a rapid growth in demand for hydroxide from about 50,000 tons per year today, doubling by 2020 and increasing eightfold by 2025."
1,"So this year we've guided I think to 18% at the midpoint, and now we've just said with this headwind we're probably into the high end of our guidance which is 19% growth in the United States. As we see some of these access wins hit, which really we see an expansion of 2019, and as we see innovation come to the market, DASH will come at the end of 2018 and then some of these further innovations will hit every year subsequent to that for the next five years/ And we see opportunity for significant expansion because we will expand the addressable market with innovation and we will continue to see competitive differentiation in the innovation that we're bringing to market."
1,"So this year, since GST has been implemented, that we would also established locations that allow cross-delivery and offer it to these companies that are already utilizing our framework that we do not monetize on today. And if we are able to do that successfully, then earning small rupees out of every delivery will mean a very significant opportunity for the company. We will not go into a CapEx intensive logistics business."
1,"So we also get a hit above the line, if you will, on the revenue side, not just on costs, but also on revenues, because of the greater productivity of the MAX, not just in terms of a larger seat configuration, but also in terms of what we expect in utilization, increase in average stage-lengths. As you know, the MAX, in addition to the 15% fuel economy on the cost side, it also has an average stage-length of another 1,000 kilometers, which allows us to increase revenues and is a key driver for us being able to add the Florida and international destinations that we're adding. So it's a combination of those factors that   in addition to what we expect in terms of the overall macroeconomic environment, it's really behind those numbers that we're providing to you on guidance."
1,"So we are really excited about the road ahead for us in fiscal 2019. We see opportunities to grow everywhere we look. We believe we are under penetrated in every geography we are in, in every vertical category we serve, and in every existing customer relationship."
1,"So we have a market that we   you can't even define the addressable market, right, I mean, it is large, we're the leader in the market today and about 50% market share. But this investment allows us to increase our capacity, but increase our capabilities, it allows us to simplify the supply chain, it allows us to take everything in-house, and not only   it's one of the best projects you can have guys, because not only is it a capacity justification based on a growing market, it's a significant cost reduction process   project as well..."
1,"So we have a very well-balanced portfolio which I think is highly complementary with the Granite portfolio. And the combination, I think, really leverages the collective strengths and will allow us to kind of capitalize on some of the market opportunities across a number of different sectors."
1,"So we just think there's a huge opportunity, and we've talked about in this presentation the economics of that customer for Albertsons and for Rite Aid. So we think we have a significant opportunity using EnvisionRx in relationships with other PBMs and payers to bring more pharmacy into our network. And with the combination, we're going to have a deeper network of pharmacies in the markets in which we compete."
1,"So we made the decision to transition out of the development business and move more toward a supply structure for the large-scale power plants, where we would take our industry-leading technology and our industry-leading solar systems, and sell them to third-party developers for them to install. What that does is it allows us to become much more diverse globally. In the past, we sell at a premium because our technology is unique and it costs a little more than our Asian competitors."
1,So we make slow and steady improvement. We see opportunity every year to make that better. And I think we avail ourselves of those opportunities as the opportunity resides in speed always.
1,So we promised ourselves and the shareholders that we're going to be very aggressive once we see that the market is stabilizing and the integration of Alon is going the way we want. And that situation allows us to buy almost $100 million of shares. We do look at the market opportunities.
1,"So we see   we will see how that develops. I do want to emphasize, as Dave talked about earlier or during the prepared remarks, that if we see opportunities of adding assets opportunistically, manufacturing assets, 300 millimeter Analog assets, we will do that. And that could drive that percent higher."
1,So we see a lot of opportunity with our existing core customer base. And then we think it will allow us to attract a whole new group of customers.
1,"So we see great opportunities across the mill system to do that. General productivity improvements through our Lean Six Sigma technicians, and then also some CapEx-related projects that we see opportunities for. So that's the major part of that slice of the pie."
1,"So we see the market with a very good behavior. And we will be able to achieve our goals and we have a balance between the supply in the domestic market and in the foreign markets, and because of that it allows us to structurally position ourselves ahead. Especially Mexico, we have some businesses and we seek new businesses there, and they seek Klabin today for paper besides the United States."
1,"So we think there's an opportunity as well as to sell additional stop loss products. It's not an area that we've actually been as intensely focused on and we do think that there's opportunity, certainly not in the largest cases, but as you move downstream into some of the cases that are moving from fully insured to self-insured, we see opportunities in the stop loss market. We also see opportunities with other services."
1,"So we use a lot of organic and inside the service type of techniques to do that. And when we look at the product and how it evolves going forward into Q4   sorry, Q1 and beyond in fiscal 2018, where we see opportunities to spend and invest UA to acquire new players or perhaps accelerate lapsed players back in, we'll take advantage of those opportunities when they present themselves."
1,"So we want to be careful how we look at this and we want to be very thoughtful and mindful as we layout our future plans. But I can tell you, right off the bat I mentioned we hired a procurement   I'll call him a procurement czar, I mean I've worked with David for a number of years, he's come in and has an excellent understanding of our supply base and the materials we purchase, and we see opportunities in improving the way that we procure our raw materials today. I think, from an SG&A perspective, we're taking a very thoughtful approach."
1,"So we're driven more by the specific opportunity than we are with the context of having a stronger balance sheet this year because of the combination of tax reform and the carry back related to ACRP. So I mentioned in my comments, it really doesn't change how we think about capital deployment, but it will allow us to be a little bit more aggressive when we find those opportunities that make sense."
1,"So we're looking at 5G as an amazing opportunity for the company not only to again to lead from a value proposition, lead with a great product, but potentially be able to charge for the blazing fast speeds. Also something that allows you to do that is when you look at 5G, you have a significant reduction on your cost per gig, and that's also another advantage that will allow us to potentially get in the place where we'd like to be, and that is be able to charge for our services while at the same time be able to reduce cost or having the lowest cost per bit. As it relates from now till the time we launch our 5G network, which we're looking at a year, we have already increased our price."
1,"So we're looking much more at the granulation. We're going to be looking at small strategic investments in things like blending capacity, in things like the potential of starting to produce products that will go into other manufacturing processes, and we've added a new pelleting line again, which allows us to again offer granulated solutions. You want powders?"
1,"So we're not even at one to one, so we see a lot of opportunity. And the other, we call Cloud Agent the Trojan Horse for us, because it's a cloud agent that allows us to deliver many new solutions such as File Integrity Monitoring, the detection of Indication of Compromise, as well as upcoming solutions like Certificate Management and Patch Management. So with one agent, you can deliver many solutions which is part of our selling proposition to our customers, you can reduce the number of agents you actually have on your device by using one Qualys agent."
1,"So we're opening about 150 stores in the United States. On the commercial side of the business, again we believe there's a significant opportunity for us to continue to gain market share and inventory availability; you'll hear me talk a little bit more about that. We have about 188 Hub stores in our chain today."
1,"So we're very excited about this partnership and what this can mean and where this can go. With data then , as we all know, really allows you to start thinking about predictive analytics, start thinking about the spine, allows us to really start thinking about big data and how to utilize it. So if we can figure that piece out which we believe we can, you can start imagining where things can go when we think about providing solutions for the full continuum of care."
1,"So we've already targeted what we need to do in 2019 and what we need to do in 2020. And by having that three-year, it allows us to get better pricing on either material or a contractor. So we are learning."
1,"So we've been increasing the size of our team and the productivity of our team so that we can continue to grow the total vendor count and the total revenue dollars in the marketplace. Good products on the user side, like Ultimate Wedding Planner, like our app which had over 1 million downloads last year, like our wedding website products, engage couples, and the UWP helps to guide those couples into the services and transactions that they need to connect them into our local marketplace, it's creates more raw material for our sales team to then sell to our vendors, and it allows us to continue to lift our vendor count and to continue to accelerate the growth of that local business."
1,"So we've established a dedicated cross division task force to accelerate progress. And we're investing in our first in-house metal printing manufacturing cell that will allow us to deepen our understanding of the technology and start to realize additive manufacturing's potential to lower production costs and reduce lead times. Our technology road map also seeks to extend our material science leadership, targeting the development of new alloys, composites and polymers that are important in maintaining our technology leadership positions and helping our customers increase their productivity further."
1,"So we've got this NGL line that's going in place, we'll be able to put natural gas liquids into a pipeline, and get them out of the basin. The other thing that, that allows us to do, as ethane continues to slightly improve, at some point in time, ethane recovery mode maybe a way to go as opposed to ethane rejection. So, you can't put ethane in trucks that just doesn't work."
1,"So what consignment lets us do is expand the catalog at no cost, because we're not putting out any capital on behalf of Ingram and Ingram doesn't have to pay us back. That allows us to have bigger catalog and more effective pricing. So that's all working to our advantage."
1,"So what I would say is that, you are right. It is a significant opportunity. To put that in context, when you look at the U."
1,"So when we talk about Imagery growing and half the business is flat that tells you the other half is growing double-digits. When that contract is extended or renewed with Maxar and DigitalGlobe, we have significant opportunity to raise that ceiling and to perform higher than this 4% to 6%. It's a clear upside in our view."
1,"So when we talk about that â‚¬75 million, we are talking about that as a subsector of the capital projects we see within IMTT. I think with respect to the $350 that I think the story is the same with respect to all other businesses but we see significant opportunity to deploy capital going forward not just in IMTT, but in some of the other verticals. But as we've   as we've talked about that in our capital management initiatives that we talk about, we are if you like providing for $350 million per annum but ensuring that we have a balance sheet, which enables us to be opportunistic given that some of these opportunities to invest are outside of our control as regards timing."
1,"So whether it's developing a much better croissant, which is just sitting in our shelves now, or whether it's improving the quality of our frozen foods, we're seeing customers responding to that. But we also see significant opportunity in omni-channel. And our view here is that customers should be able to shop when they want, where they want and how they want."
1,"So with bank number two, I would think about a similar investment and then revenue ramp cycle happening in 2019-2020. And then, again, as we implement subsequent banks, we believe some of the technology investments we are making this year will allow us to bring on new banks more quickly and in a more scalable way with less fixed upfront investment. So again, I don't want to sort of give an impression that the return is instantaneous, but I think when you think about kind of a classic enterprise software or enterprise sale, it's quite a normal return timeframe of a couple of years."
1,"So with stores that Tuniu opened, we are able to control the quality of our services and to better engage with our customers and to provide the correct products to these customers whereas the franchise model, it's much more difficult. In terms of   by running our own stores we are able to protect one of the key assets to Tuniu which is our customers, and by using these stores we could extract the most amount of value from our customers as we are able to give them that services and products, this allows us to improve the repurchase rate and engagement in a much better levels than using a franchise model. The general logical we use in opening our stores is we identify where the new customers are online and then we are able to find the locations where they could be offline and then we try to open stores within those areas."
1,"So you guys can do the math. This is a significant opportunity. And, frankly, the reason we're doing this is, it's just we think the best of both worlds for a patient is to have one operation that last them their life and is least burdensome on their lifestyle by taking a blood thinner that's much friendlier."
1,"So you'll see more capital going into Services as an example. But as you mentioned, in Defense, as we see opportunities there, if they make sense and they deliver value back to the bottom line, we're going to make the right and prudent investments in capital in that business. So as those opportunities come upon themselves, frankly, if we have an opportunity to get ahead of it and derisk some of those initiatives or investments, we'll do that as well."
1,"So you're starting to see that. I think our acquisition in Northwest Line will allow us to train those   our folks in the field faster and we could put more crews together and grow that business. But if you look at the growth of the business, I think we can grow it in the high to mid-single digits year-over-year."
1,"So, 25% of our capital employed is in South Africa. We are at the moment probably spending more of our capital base outside of South Africa because that's where we see significant opportunities. But that doesn't mean we're not looking after the assets, putting capital into the assets to make sure they deliver."
1,"So, 25% of our capital employed is in South Africa. We are, at the moment, probably spending more of our capital base outside of South Africa, because that's where we see significant opportunities. But that doesn't mean we're not looking after the assets, putting capital into the assets to make sure they deliver."
1,"So, 45 new A&W restaurants opened across the country in 2017, 27 of which were in Ontario and QuÃ©bec. Now, of a particular significance is that 16 of the 45 restaurants that we opened in the year were the urban concept designed restaurants and that's the design we've talked about in the past that really allows us to leverage the opportunity that exists around the increasing urbanization of Canada with you know the rapid growth in terms of the number of people living, working, and playing in big cities. So, 16 was important for us there."
1,"So, again, you've talked to the scale across the business. What comes with that is a significant opportunity when you can drive incremental revenue because that revenue tends to come in at a very attractive margin. So, I think, to Bill's point, we are very excited about our business, and I think it's the reason Bill and SS&C are excited about the business."
1,"So, as that aircraft matures, and as ownership costs decline, and as fuel prices maybe change, so, we're looking at an aircraft decision as much as anything else. We still see opportunity with the Airbus aircraft, and we see opportunity with the Boeing aircraft. And we want to make sure   so, the chart you saw, so, I think, it's the shaded aircraft, which shows the opportunity and all the time we're looking at flexibility."
1,"So, Ben, as we've talked about in our acquisition analysis, that $50 million synergy target is cost synergy. It does not count revenue synergies, and there are significant opportunities. And that is part of our overall deal logic here is that as you point out, there are cross-selling opportunities for Electric, Gas and Water, endpoints provided by Itron underneath former Silver Spring existing networks, there are street lighting and distribution automation, cross-selling opportunities of former Silver Spring technology under Itron customer base, and ultimately a very strong opportunity for the cross-sell of managed services and other software and data analytics across the portfolio."
1,"So, bringing in somebody to lead that, I would say, transformation of that space, that intimate apparel space for Chico's FAS and leading digitally there is exciting. And then the addition of David, who's from Zara, Topshop, has that fast fashion background, can bring speed, agility as well as real merchant and operational sense, I think, builds that team that will allow us to leverage all of those talents to grow that space."
1,"So, financial planning, budgeting, investment management, and that's where they still spend the most of their time. But now, we see opportunities to get into protection. And there's the very logical piece where advisors working with high-net clients may want to have income guarantees in retirement."
1,"So, for the most part, our activities are focused around facilitating the investment business of the firm. It also allows us to grow those businesses faster. So if you think about it, you had a $3 billion Infrastructure Fund II."
1,"So, from a commercial perspective, we entered 2018 with very, very good momentum. Second, from the perspective of short-term catalysts, when we focus on oncology, there are four significant opportunities that I am looking at and focused on with respect to OPDIVO. The first one is first-line lung cancer."
1,"So, fundamentally what that does is, it kind of doubles that market. Kind of the run-rate in that market is give or take CAD 2 billion over that period of time, and we see opportunities to address a large fraction of that. Some of that's not addressable, but the fraction of it that's addressable to us is pretty substantial in the area of components, in the area of services and things of that nature."
1,"So, he's got a tremendous industry experience, but also experience with both those businesses. Combining both of those businesses under one roof are going to give us enormous opportunity for efficiency improvements, yield improvements, and equally importantly, will allow us to capitalize on the fungibility of those assets as we shift those assets towards our higher margin type opportunities. We've also combined our sales organization in the semiconductor operation, so the Wolfspeed sales organization and the LED sales organization under one roof and have brought in Thomas Wessel to run that organization."
1,"So, I actually think, as we get through the next few months and lay out where we're going I'd expect you'd see in that part of the business solid performance next year and some of the things we should be able to do quite quickly to drive good performance in the outer year. So, I think the beauty of what we've done with the B+I business and how we've focused it, allows us to really get on with the broader Fletcher's business quite quickly, and I mean obviously   and what we'll do, and Simon, it might be a bit frustrating, but we will lay that pathway out comprehensively in June, but I'm quite optimistic we'll be able to move at pace."
1,"So, I believe, that war is well underway. It's not been all delivered, all the opportunities haven't been captured, but that progress is showing in in the results, and we feel confident together, we're just going to be able to accelerate that with even more opportunities."
1,"So, I don't see that this would   this is something that's limited in the short term. ThreatMetrix, the way we look at this is, this is a very well-established company in this segment, but we see significant opportunities in this segment going forward because we have so much history ourselves in physical, biological identities of individuals, and now we're combining this with their sort of leadership in digital and device identities. And we think and we've seen that that adds significant value to customer sets that we already serve and we're going to continue to expand that value by continuing to broaden out the product suite and to integrate services and to build out our sales efforts."
1,"So, I mean, in terms of the sale, yes, it is in the Corporate Services segment and specifically in the corporate solutions part of the Corporate Services segment. In terms of the long range outlook, we will continue to assess that as we complete the acquisition or divestiture to understand our views in terms of the long-term growth of the remaining assets and make sure that we feel confident in our ability to deliver against the growth profile there. But we're currently assessing that."
1,"So, I think we've really done, and we've said at the start of this is, we've added a third leg of the stool. It gives us a significant opportunity to influence product sales, influence service sales, and influence a significantly higher margin business for the company going forward. And so we've really put the $1 billion mark out to say that's the math on what we've been saying all along, and this just gives you a much greater sense of security that we have a path forward, that we're going to get there and we're going to get there in a more profitable way."
1,"So, I think, that our long range plan, we believe that this allows us to do things differently. One of the things that you get and the benefits of the 3D printing here is we're getting the translucency in a product that solves irrelevant problem."
1,"So, I think, what we said in December when we had the call to announce the Signode transaction, that this would not change our strategy with respect to our existing can businesses, be it a beverage, food, or aerosol. And so, where we see opportunity to grow the business organically, we're going to continue to try to win as many of those opportunities as we can. But from time to time, capital might be plus or minus $25 million or plus or minus $50 million one year to the next, depending on the number of opportunities and the rate at which we complete those opportunities in any given year."
1,"So, I would say in general, you go back to the Q2, Q3 calls we had, we talked a lot about the new wins that we had with clients and we're continuing to try to provide updates as examples only on our subsequent calls, and we'll continue to do so on our going-forward calls. I would say across the company, our overall client base continues to expand, and we're looking to   and every single one of those clients we bring onboard represents   through a particular product or service offering represents a significant opportunity for us to sell our other products and service offerings to them, and we are acutely focused on doing that; and it's one of the things that we believe differentiates our performance from a lot of others within the industry as once we get those clients in, we have a significant portfolio of products and services to sell to that client base. So, new wins, certainly expanding our position through those new wins, number of clients, but also then aggressively going after selling them additional products and services to help simplify the complexity of their supply chain as well as to help them reduce costs."
1,"So, I would say that much more focused towards providing pipe and growth capacity as we see   again, the majority of these healthcare real estate trends that reverberate throughout our markets are quite positive and that we have to see this growing an asset-heavy operators likely to look for capital solutions and we're capable of taking them. And so, we see very significant opportunity to grow the business over time and really this is to position ourselves both in the public context and with additional diversified capital to pursue that scale and in our leadership position. So, very much around about having pipeline capacity and the ability to preserve meaningful target."
1,"So, I'll build this out. To summarize then, we've got a leading optical technology performance that allows us to deploy bandwidth at scale and allows a unique experience for our customers because, remember, what we do is we utilize that, as Dave talked about, to be able to use instant bandwidth and instant network capabilities. So, our customers can now turn on bandwidth in seconds and minutes to meet their requirement and it allows them to differentiate themselves at their service level, and we do it based on a unique technology, and that gives them the benefits of the cost of ownership and the experience."
1,"So, I'm going to briefly outline the value proposition of our PBM acquisition and growth to the business model. First, it allows us to have access to new specialty prescriptions that are being filled by other providers in the marketplace. This is a great opportunity for us."
1,"So, in some of these cases, our model will be two quarters to kind of have a final kind of head count, final clause taken out. But why we're so excited is we also have people that are very, very talented, that will allow us to do smaller acquisitions without a little bit labor and even increase the target of the 50% EBITDA for those smaller acquisitions. I think these will be about 10% lower in contribution, but again from a scale perspective, it will pay off for us long term."
1,"So, in summary, I just want to say that we're incredibly proud of our teams working hard everywhere to drive volume, manage costs, and deliver an outstanding year of 13% EPS growth and tremendous free cash flow in 2017, demonstrating our ability to grow both of our specialty businesses which is now becoming above 70% of our total earnings. And we're really excited about Innovation Day next week where we're going to walk through how we're going to keep driving that, keep improving these businesses, stabilize and improve Fibers and our growth model allows us to sustain this year-over-year. So, look forward to seeing you, guys, on Tuesday morning."
1,"So, in summary, our Sensors business is firing on all cylinders from an execution standpoint and taking maximum advantage of a strong and growing demand for industrial sensors that are essential for the launch of our customers' new products and the growth of industrial automation and smart systems. Geographically, our scale allows us to access all markets globally, which is paying dividends in the U. S."
1,"So, it really depends on the product demand from the customers, whether it's more propane or butane. And then, refurbishing the dock, or really redoing the dock, and upgrading the dock will allow us to have more flexibility on what ships we can load out of there. So it really depends on the vessel size demand and the demand for the product."
1,"So, it's a good news story in terms of both the cost base for the business, but more importantly, how we service our customers, right? Because we've got automation there that allows us to pick overnight to do a whole range of things we can't currently do at the moment, gives us additional capacity, so we can service our customers much better in each of those states as well. So, I think that's a big advantage."
1,"So, it's a place where there's some real subtleties about how you actually treat it and we're very fortunate that the FDA was confident enough in our discussions to let us go directly into patients because you can't really measure PK effectively in the eye. And so, that allows us to actually go directly into it. We think that market as well   so it's going to be 2023 because of the patents that we have to get through to be able to launch that program."
1,"So, it's not complete the development and then it's a static balance. We see opportunities for investment and strong growth in some of the infrastructure and manufacturing parts of our portfolio as well. And then, as we think about our growth priorities as I talk through those and really our plan and priorities broadly, we come into everything with a strong customer first mindset."
1,"So, just to confirm in our press release, we did announce new patents around chat bots functionality, but we did not announce new products around chat bot functionality. We think this space has a significant opportunity in the future as we eventually think about expanding our product line even further outside of PBR. The potential to have a chat bot that recognizes your personality style, your behavioral characteristics and is able to change the way that it interacts with you based off all that data."
1,"So, like I mentioned, a lot of registered shoppers, and that's growing, but within that, the user base continues to grow every month. So a very significant opportunity for more growth from the retailers that are already on the platform and growing. I will add one more thing to that is, even today, and you heard that from my prepared remarks, even today, even with the user base that's there, which is a good user base but growing even more, the demand for coupons is outstripping the supply of coupons with the budgets from the CPGs."
1,"So, Marc, we continue to move towards building out the development stage pipeline. That's where we see opportunities. We perceived that there's a healthy environment that exists for the funding and development of medicines for rare diseases."
1,"So, Mohit, as we described, the end-of-Phase 1 meeting was I would say pretty comprehensive. And the information request for the CMC piece, pre-clinical piece and clinical aspect from the FDA I think allow us to respond within a certain timeframe, which we have always   already communicated to the FDA and agreed upon, which I think sets the stage for what I would consider successful pre-BLA meeting, which then allows us to submit a BLA package that will be data driven and hopefully will lead to an approval. So, at this point in time, based on our interactions with the FDA, I feel confident the process that we've laid out will lead us towards the path for success."
1,"So, obviously, TDC and all our brands use quite a lot of resources, marketing our various products and services. Now this partnership or this deal with MTG, of course, will allow us to have a more efficient way of doing that on all the channels that you heard Anders speak to before. There are some content synergies in here, but not a lot because again, as we said, we do expect and we do invite continued partnerships with all the other content owners and providers out there."
1,"So, of course, we are able to sign deals like that because of the substantial differentiation and performance of our core technology and the capabilities of our cloud platform. This allows us to enable a broad base of sequencing partners, which is an incredibly valuable capability. Of course, we have a tremendous amount of earnings power embedded in our existing average-risk NIPT and microdeletions volumes that are not currently reimbursed by insurance, which we've broken out here between low risk NIPT and microdeletions."
1,"So, on revenue growth, we will continue to deliver in the long-term 5% growth if it's done organically and 10% growth via acquisitions. We feel very good that the plans we have in place will allow us to achieve these targets. EPS growth of continually delivering 10% earnings per share growth year-over-year, doing it in such a way that our return on invested capital continues to exceed 10% as well after tax."
1,"So, our goal is not to create a very large handset business. It just so happens in the case of wireless power, that's the initial application that is driving the volume opportunity and allows us to leverage some technology that we developed and also get a lot of cycles of learning in high-volume applications that can allow us to take that learning and apply it to other areas. But if you look at the rest of the company   certainly if you look at comms infrastructure, 30% of our revenue, you're talking about lifecycles that probably start with five years and get into new decades potentially."
1,"So, our view is, is that we will continue to innovate. We will also create solution sets that give us the type of margin profile we are after, that also allows us to be even more price-competitive and preserve our margins. So, you'll see some of these types of products continue to come out into the marketplace."
1,"So, over time, we do want to grow. We think there's value in growth, bigger platform allows us to address the needs of our clients or sponsored clients in a more meaningful way. So, we do believe there is value at scale."
1,"So, similarly enormous opportunity within those organizations, $44 billion overall. The second dimension that comes into play when we think about TAM is not just how many organizations we're working in today, but when we look at the profile of those organizations, again Josh is going to do some cohort analysis, we have enormous amount of data at our disposal that allows us to model out from initial time of engagement with CyberArk, the typical path that an organization of a certain profile follows with us. And so, when we think about the addressable opportunity for organizations over $1 billion, you can see that we have just about a 3% TAM penetration."
1,"So, that is mainly for the conventional fund development, but we also have got a license in Shenzhen to develop private equity. That is the QFLP license, which will allow us to raise money both on and offshore to invest in Mainland private equity project, and we have recently set up a new team to look into that opportunity. So, we are very excited about our China development."
1,"So, that was a staple try to land with a very sticky product such as the ERP and then start expanding beyond that. One of the very important decisions and strategies that Steve had was, well, as we added ancillary services, we've had services that are agnostic to the property management system, meaning you no longer require to sell the RealPage ERP, you can now penetrate into the third-party property management systems, which allows us to have the flexibility, Brian, not to just focus on ERP, but we can also expand around third-party ERPs, which   quite honestly, that's the majority of the RPU opportunity. It's not the core management, property management system, it's the payment surrenders, Asset Optimization products."
1,"So, that's one contributor in there. We also have quite a lot of innovative offering that allows us to drive penetration in market activities where we have not been so active in the past. The grid consulting piece is one that we're ramping up in a strong way."
1,"So, the breakdown of the quoting activity that we have visibility over today is about $500 million of it is in electrification, about $200 million of it is in connectivity. As far as the margin profile, we believe it's acquisitions like this that will allow us to continue to maintain the margin profile that we're talking about while continuing to grow the business. So, its added capabilities are going to give us opportunities to quote larger pools of business."
1,"So, the net of all that is we think that Cable margins improved by up to 50 basis points this year versus last. And I'd say we don't go beyond a year but I guess I'd hearken back to what I said at the beginning, we are very focused at the total level and in each of the businesses and the algorithm that allows us to continue to deliver EBITDA growth and managing all the levers in these various businesses."
1,"So, there is an endless supply of companies that's really getting to those key criteria of proof-of-concept or key clinical data with the right market opportunity in the long-term. So we see significant opportunity to achieve the goals that Bob just outlined."
1,"So, there's really a major job in terms of productivity and improving plant efficiency in terms of waste and labor content to enable us to maintain gross margins. And we think our plans will allow us to achieve this."
1,"So, these are the goals. It all starts again with the top line growing the business at a rate that allows us to leverage the infrastructure and that leverage together with the benefit of our new organization and systems should allow us to achieve 20% or greater EBITDA margins and ultimately drive shareholder value. There."
1,"So, they want to just integration of this along with the our existing software facility, because in Maharashtra Border Check Post, all the check-posts are interconnected and also centrally connected to the Mumbai, Central Control Room through its own dedicated basically linkages with the data network, all these network and even speed as well as even all the data which can be transferred is very high actually, which the government has designed for our coming 50 years keeping in mind actually. So, we are not incurring any other additional cost, but definitely this will allow us to take some incremental revenue in terms of the   obviously once the additional department will start looking into the same. So to fulfill their requirement, whatever arrangement needs to be done at check-post level, this will add the revenue for us."
1,"So, this is a strong track record on retention rate and also shows that we give an excellent service and government recognized it. So, we feel confident we can continue with such strong rate. This is a key slide which shows the market opportunity we see for our best business."
1,"So, this will be accretive for the organization virtually from day one. Very exciting opportunity and it allows us to get in touch directly with the European community, have direct access to patients and provide products that really are tailored toward the European market opportunity. Finally on a manufacturing side, we have built and are building a manufacturing plant in Acton, Massachusetts where we are installing four high-speed   we are restoring lines, manufacturing lines and replace that has the capacity to perform virtually 70% of the four lines that we currently have in China."
1,"So, very promising. Ultimately, as you can imagine, that program really has the most significant opportunity for scale when you combine it with the PC Optimum Program. And so, the way to think about the pilot is that we will continue to operate it, we will continue to learn, we will continue to optimize the value proposition."
1,"So, Vince, we continue to see some expansion within our existing client base, clients that have worked with us for many, many years. And then, beyond that, we have won some significant opportunities in the UK and in Europe. As you know, we've won a very large UK bank engagement, thereby we have taken over our application development, application maintenance and application rationalization for all of their market systems."
1,"So, watching deposit declines before you would begin to see loan growth, that hasn't necessarily manifested itself in that manner. And so, if you look at us specifically, I think that that just stabilizing commercial real estate now that we're well inside our internal concentration limits and have capacity to grow through 2018, I think that in and of itself really allows us to achieve our mid-single-digit kind of target that we have established for 2018, Peter."
1,"So, we achieved a good portion of the $40 million in 2017. The $25 million that we've identified ahead of us, I would say that the cadence there would be somewhat consistent with kind of just the normal cycle of operations in our business, obviously higher in Q2 and Q3, but we have identified those and we feel confident with the plan that we can achieve those. And that's a combination of savings here, what we call the Property Support Center which is corporate, labor and non-labor and then also in our parks, a combination of labor and non-labor savings."
1,"So, we are assuming rising rates, but those are going to come in 25 basis point to 50 basis point increments which that's the environment that we really drive in, right, that all insurance companies do. It allows us to pick up a little bit more spread on the in-force book. It makes selling new product more attractive."
1,"So, we are developing AXS-05 for treatment resistant depression and Alzheimer's disease agitation, and we intend to develop AXS-09 for future indications. So what this will allow us to do is utilize AXS-05 and AXS-09 to take advantage of the various different mechanisms of action of these agents to really address not only the current indications, but also all of the potential indications, which we have previously outlined may be applicable to the pharmacology of these agents."
1,"So, we are very much going to be trying to leverage the fast-track application   the fast-track designation that we've received from the FDA for this product and for this indication; that will allow us to have a potentially rolling application and a priority review by the agency. So, if everything goes to plan, then we would be looking to have an approvable product some time during the course of 2019."
1,"So, we have some elements of the protocols that we've got that allows us actually to do some additional dose changes within individuals moving forward, so we can improve our understanding of the dose response relationship. So based on what we have at the moment is and we've giving guidance to this that we believe that we'll have repeat adult and pediatric data by the third quarter, and we will have   is that we'll have the information generated that will allow us to design our pivotal study by the end of the year and obviously initiate our pivotal study in 2019. So, I think that speaks to our confidence that we actually will and we will be generating the information that we need to design a solid pivotal study."
1,"So, we still see the opportunity of growth in the future once we introduce Apoquel, Cytopoint, and Simparica in the Chinese market. We still see significant opportunities for growth in international markets because the level of penetration of Apoquel, Cytopoint, and Simparica compared to the U. S."
1,"So, we will spend   as soon as the weather turns to spring and we are able to get into that property, we have the contracts ready to clear the land and start the construction of the RV Park. The majority of that will be happening in 2018 which will allow us to open the bulk of it in 2019. There will still be some elements that will be building out in early or in the 2019 season."
1,"So, we'll build parallel pipelines and we'll build compressor stations with multiple inlets to give us the ability to free flow a new Utica or new Marcellus well, while at the same time we can flow existing Marcellus from that same well pad through compression. It's flexible and it's also efficient, because it allows us to right-size pipelines and time compression for each reservoir rather than oversizing pipe or installing too much compression horsepower too soon. And our build out is even more efficient, because we've worked with CNX to use well pad timing around our system to get the most use out of existing Midstream assets."
1,"So, we'll continue, and I think we're on a great trajectory. But most important for me is as we get into international markets, we got approval in Canada, which we think is a significant opportunity. The dynamics there is RESTASIS is already generic."
1,"So, we're going to continue to manage responsibly. We continue to believe that the strong cash flow from operations allows us to do all of this. And at the same time, I'm taking advantage of the new tax laws with the CapEx that's really used to continue to grow our business, but also we get the 100% deduction for the next five years."
1,"So, we're very encouraged because what we've really had has been thinking of them is small underwriting agents scattered in the continent in places like Milan and Paris and in Rotterdam and Antwerp. This really brings a hub to that operation, so it allows us to do more things on the continent that previously would have had to been done in London or outsourced or what have you. So, I think it really gives us great opportunity for the EU to really become a business for us, that's kind of self -sustaining and has some scale to it."
1,"So, we've got this very large diverse platform of over 7,500 products that's allowed us to, like I said, create scale and diversification be meaningful to our customers and continue to bring these important products to market. And I think Teva and Sandoz are focused very differently right now and we see opportunity in that. Because they think there's opportunity for us to pick up supply."
1,"So, we've said before that we see opportunity across the   all segments, but we are more focused on building our book in terms of SME and retail. So, you see differential focus from our side in those two segments, but we see opportunity across the platform."
1,"So, when I think about 2018, I would say that we are pretty bullish on memory. And we expect vertical NAND bit density to increase between 40% to 50%, and we know that this will have a positive impact on our business with significant opportunities around deposition materials, but also emerging opportunities with our FOUP platform and contamination control solutions. I am very bullish on IoT trends as well, and that will benefit all three divisions of Entegris."
1,"So, when we come back to the United States, North America segment, we're not shying away from that market. Now, what we have done is to execute on this diversification and differentiation that allows us to absorb the volatility inherent in this market. So, the more that we've shown that we can take our substantial free cash flows and have a 70%, 75% durability on those cash flows because of either our geographic, our portfolio where in the instance of the United States, products that would require   we would have runway to see generic competition."
1,"So, when we talk about that â‚¬75 million, we are talking about that as a subsector of the capital projects we see within IMTT. I think with respect to the $350 million that I think the story is the same with respect to our other businesses, but we see significant opportunity to deploy capital going forward, not just in IMTT, but in some of the other verticals. But as we've   as we've talked about that in our capital management initiatives that we talk about   we are, if you like providing for $350 million per annum, but ensuring that we have a balance sheet, which enables us to be opportunistic given that some of these opportunities to invest are outside of our control as regard to timing."
1,"So, when you look at samples, when you look at   entries is always   more   request more resources than just to grow a business once you are already in the market regarding training, regarding sampling and all of these kind of things. And this allows us to alleviate a bit the sales and marketing expenses. As for the   and in terms of revenues, we are remembering that we have a contract with the U."
1,"So, when you look at that structure all together, we believe we're in very good condition. That allows us to really look at capital allocation and look at M&As opportunities, look at other opportunities as well. Finally, I would add that as a result of the tax reform, we have identified over $1 billion of what was previously permanently reinvested cash overseas that can be returned without U."
1,"So, when you see and when you're growing your online sales, you want multiple ways for that customer to interact with you, and certainly, they can send that directly back, having that brought back into the store and converting that transaction. And then also, to Todd's point, about the dispersal of our sites across our geography allows us to have nearly 1,500 points of distribution that we now have shared inventory, we have visibility into that inventory, and are able to locate that product for customers in store, and soon, we'll be able to ship that product from any of those many distribution centers. And so, with the fact that three quarters of our leases are up in the next three years, this is that opportunity to optimize that fleet as a sales center, as a return center, as a distribution center."
1,"So, with more listening, we learn a lot about what they like and what they don't like. This allows us to make even more customized and relevant recommendations to the users, helping them to discover more music. So, bit by bit, users form new listening habits and they become more engaged."
1,"So, yeah, our oil and gas customers have the largest market share by far in that segment. What this merger allows us to do is provide services to those customers at a competitive price, freeing up their own resources to focus on what they do, which is finding and producing oil and gas. So there is a strong competitive environment out there the number of competitors."
1,"SolarEdge is generating a lot of cash at the end of the quarter, we finished with about $305 million. We have no debt and we generate close to $35 million of cash flow from operations on a quarterly basis, which means that it really allows us to be in a position where we can invest a lot in future growth into new markets, either markets in Asia or in Africa, Latin America markets in which we do not operate today. It allows us to go into new industries either by buying companies or developing new technologies based on what we know and also allows us in a market that is characterized with so many bankruptcies with so much instability around module companies, inverter companies to be a trusted partners of most of the installers that feel that when SolarEdge is giving 12 years to 25 years of warranty to its product, it is actually going to be there in order to provide and to fulfil this warranty."
1,"Some may include us giving   selling those products or giving those products to other vendors. I think there's really significant opportunities as we go through the portfolio. And as we gain confidence like we have in the Services, I think this team is highly motivated to go execute against the drivers."
1,"Some of it is converting older technology to an electromechanical-based system. So, that's why we feel confident that we'll see good growth for a number years to come there."
1,"Some of the new features including premium user experience, voice support with Amazon Alexa, and an access to a large library of content through the support of Netflix and YouTube on the platform. We signed an agreement with Netflix, which allows us to offer Netflix to our Elevate Cloud SaaS operator customers. We also formed a partnership with Google to bring access to billions of videos available on YouTube to our customers."
1,"Sounds very simple, but I think once patients start to see the value of experiencing that data and clinicians are able to build on it that this could be a really exciting field for us in the next several years. The connectivity also allows us to bring in other feature set, one is the display on smart watches. We're able to display our glucose information on the Apple Watch."
1,"Specifically, our CD33 ARC has minimal extramedullary toxicities, particularly no signs of veno-occlusive disease. It does not rely on internalization of the antigen target and has high potency that allows us to administer low doses of protein, the treatment consisting of only one or two infusions. This year, our objective is to extend our leadership position as the only multi-disciplinary CD33 program in the industry with best-in-class potential."
1,"Starting with our omni-channel strategy. We see significant opportunity ahead to build on our market share through a combination of continued, measured retail expansion and e-commerce growth. As the convergence of brick and mortar and online has become the customer expectation, we see even more opportunity to interact with not only our existing customers, but also to attract new customers who are not within driving distance of our store base."
1,"Stock-Prep manufacturing was not in the same location as our engineering, purchasing and other production support personnel. This new facility allows us to bring all these functions together. While the start-up of any new operation, I should say, has inefficiencies to work through, we're pleased with the progress we've made to-date, and we expect to be fully operational on this by midsummer."
1,"Sure. Our belief all along has been, given the very large capital needs for any new power plant, our model has always been to bring in funding partners which allows us to get greater economies of scale, lower cost of capital, diversify and broaden the portfolio, and increase kind of competitive advantages in acquiring a new pipeline and funding a new pipeline. So, what we're seeing in India though is that process isn't proven enough, and so we're just being careful about we're ready to put more money into it but we want to see the other folks come in, and we have a lot of discussions ongoing about that."
1,"Sure. Yeah, so in advance of the new revenue recognition standard, we made a decision to take a look at new systems that will allow us to get the information necessary to implement the standard. As part of that, we implemented or we are in the process of implementing new systems in two different areas, one on our hospital side, one on our physician provider side."
1,"Switching to our Energy segment. In general, the energy sector continues to have significant opportunities that are aligned with our deep expertise in energy efficiency, alternative generation strategies and good modernization. For 2018, we anticipate that growth from our U."
1,"Tax reform will be a wind in our sail in 2018 with an effective rate going down to 23% to 24%, but also the ability to pull back upwards at $75 million to $100 million of cash from our foreign affiliates. When we look at that expectation from repatriation, much of that's heavily weighted to Q2, Q3 and Q4, but we're already starting to see some performance and some ability to pull some of that cash back in the first quarter and we'll continue to ramp up and accelerate some of that work that will allow us to continue to deploy capital to continue to go after targets, to continue to acquire and invest in R&D and return cash to the shareholder base, as we continue to drive improvements in our cash flow performance. Longer term expectations as I started today, revenue growth from a standpoint of mid-single-digit, we think that's very achievable over the next several years, over the next two years to three years."
1,"Tax Reform will flow directly through to our earnings. Also, we expect incremental cash flow that will allow us to both continue our strategy of returning capital to our shareholders while maintaining appropriate leverage. In order to ensure that this is the case, we have been working on a comprehensive review of our cost base that we believe will generate additional margin improvement and SG&A benefits that should fund most of our long-term strategic initiatives and also help address the need for wage increases for our store associates to make sure we remain competitive in the labor market."
1,"tax reform, not only on the liquidity front, but on the earnings front as well. But, as you remember   if you might recall on our fourth quarter call, we had mentioned the opportunity to bring back upwards of $100 million of cash from our foreign affiliates to repatriate that in a cash-efficient manner that will allow us to continue to invest in growth and bring on acquisitions like General Monitors, bring on acquisitions like Globe and like Latchways, and then in turn return value to our shareholders. Liquidity is only one side of the equation on tax reform for MSA."
1,"Tembec brings a complementary portfolio of high purity cellulose products given their strength in ethers, which builds on our existing strength in acetates and other specialty market segments, creating a global leader of cellulose-based technologies. As shown on slide 4, this combination creates a broader and more diverse product offering which will allow us to better serve our customers globally, while immediately rebalancing our portfolio across acetate, ethers, specialties, viscose, and fluff products. Combined, we'll have an attractive portfolio of products that is capable of serving a variety of end markets."
1,"Thank you, Daryl. In summary, while we faced near-term market challenges, I feel confident that both our market position and expanded global reach will allow us to take share and benefit from cross-selling opportunities over the long term. We'll continue to invest in our core products and new cloud based initiatives where we're being highly disciplined on our cost structure, driving cost efficiencies throughout the organization."
1,"Thank you, David. Look, overall, what I would say is that, our strategy around M&A will likely stay quite consistent with what we talked about before, and it really starts with unmet medical need, what do we see there to be significant opportunities to improve care for patients, what do we see as being value creating, and what do we see as being something that we can execute with a high degree of effectiveness and efficiency. Now, regarding tax reform, what we said from the very beginning is, one of the major reasons in addition to lowering the rate is just frankly the flexibility that it provides us, and we think it actually helps make us more competitive, particularly on an international level if we happen to be in a competitive situation with other companies, because now we have greater flexibility on how we can access that cash."
1,"Thank you, Larry. In summary, we believe our strong cash position and our technical expertise will allow us to continue to advance our two clinical programs and our preclinical program as planned. We should be receiving our HSV-2 data in the second quarter of this year of VL-2397 antifungal studies moving forward as planned."
1,"Thanks for the question. I mean, ALXN1210 is a significant opportunity for patients first and foremost and as well, of course, for Alexion to step back from ALXN1210 for a moment, we think it's really important to continue to emphasize that Soliris already sets a high bar for PNH, and that's important for patients, of course. It's important for us as a business when we look at the surround sound of competition that are looking to enter into the space, and to have the standard is quite an advantage."
1,"Thanks to the talent and the work ethic of our employees and the tremendous quality of our assets, we have entered into a new era, one where we remain laser-focused on increasing operational efficiencies, maintaining our industry-leading, low-cost structure, and exponentially growing production within the STACK as we establish ourselves as a premier operator within the play. Our 2018 program will allow us to deliver strong repeatable results as we demonstrate the value of our extensive Canadian and Garfield County acreage and maintain our low-cost structure. I am confident these efforts will allow us to generate outstanding value for our stockholders for years to come."
1,"Thanks, Michael. As we start the new year, there continues to be significant opportunities to meaningfully grow revenues and profitability. We remain focused on our core insulation installed business while further expanding our services to new geographies, end markets and product lines."
1,"That all said, I think inevitably sales in this market evolves down the digital pathway and that using WeChat or Alibaba or whatever the case may be that most of the   if I look into my crystal ball five years out, most of the sales will be through digital channels. The big source of advantage we believe we have in this market is the access to medical data for reasons I won't go into today, but that early insight into medical data and   will allow us to better understand who we are insuring, whether or not we want insured them at all and if we do, how we want to price it or how we want to help them manage care."
1,"That being said, in the meantime years and leading up into this year in fact, specialty generics, which are different obviously than biosimilars, have become an important dynamic year-over-year as we work to drive the kind of drug trends that we talked about earlier in our prepared remarks. And so when I'm looking backward at things like GLEEVEC for the treatment of certain types of cancer or looking forward this year, for example, to COPAXONE 40 and to potentially TRACLEER and a couple of other drugs, we see opportunities to meaningfully go at the broadly-defined specialty space even as we wait for a true biologic equivalent to come to market, which we are very excited about. Everett, do you want to add any additional color there?"
1,"That being said, we've been able to partner up with the third-party delivery companies we use, as well as the fact that in many of our own cases at BJ's, in many of our restaurants, we developed our own online platform that comes right to us. So we keep all the data and all the information, and that allows us to email those guests and maybe give them special offers, even though it's being delivered by a third-party delivery company. So it's been a combination of those two things, but I would tend to say that the incremental growth in off-premise has been primarily all third-party delivery or all delivery."
1,"That burns a lot of gas, that's probably negative margins waiting for those periods of high insurance. With a building at Barker Inlet, that allows us to pull that unit and leave some of the B units and reserve the high demand period of the year where you get more sustained high prices. So, it is part of the process we've been looking at when we look to the Barker Inlet power station and forms a lot of the business case around Barker Inlet."
1,"That controller has information that's of significant value, it's got information that helps us maintain them, but it also has information that helps a landlord, a developer, a building manager have true awareness of what's going on in their business and in their building. This will allow us to improve our productivity, but we believe that this will offer new revenue opportunities and potentially new monetization opportunities for us by using the data, by having a different passenger experience, more to follow there, and you'll see condition-based maintenance in one of the demonstrations. Otis has been doing remote monitoring since the 1980s."
1,That costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time. Opening up that facility in the Pacific Northwest allows us to cut out a lot of cost and time for the consumer. So we're excited about the opportunities here.
1,"That in and of itself as an attribute may make brexanolone more appealing to some moms than SAGE-217. So, that's one characteristic, but there's others that we see will play out as the clinical trials for SAGE-217 finalize and finish, and allows us to co-position. So we see it as a market growing opportunity."
1,"That is in the FTE number that we give you. So, the absolute number of any employees increases particularly, yes, zero-hour contracts in the UK, but greater flexibility in our contracts, more part-time working, which allows us to schedule labor more accurate to the peaks and troughs of demand. And that that absolutely is the model that we're looking for as we go forward."
1,"That is the level of collaboration we've had with AWS. Yeah, there will be others over time, but we're the first, and that allows us to get that market traction and that leverage we need to capture that opportunity. So, again, across net new customers, faster sales velocity, and access to broader capabilities that allow us to get to market faster for customers, ultimately is a win-win."
1,"That is what will define the next transformation of Couche-Tard, already started. That is what will allow us to position ourselves to ensure value to our shareholders. It is a tremendous opportunity made possible by rapidly advancing technology."
1,"That question I think is similar to the others, where we continue to take the view that it's valuable to have the liquidity and the low leverage balance sheet that we have and we like to have the cash and liquidity on hand. We think there's a difference between liquidity and low leverage and we're going to continue to be take the tact that you've seen us take which is to preserve that liquidity, so we can be nimble if we see opportunity in the market."
1,"That really drives a smoother product delivery. It does allow us to match our customer price and it allows us to improve and sustain revenue and margins going forward. So, we don't see any technology disruptions."
1,"That's a compelling opportunity for us. So, as Bill C-49 gets debated, if it comes through the way we feel like it's going to come through, the way the government has indicated that it will for the bifurcated cost index which allows us to get the benefit for our shareholders for the investment, we've got money set aside, that's involved in ramping up that CapEx to buy 5,000 state-of-the-art, modern, optimal, they're shorter cars, they weigh less, they haul more grain. You could apply those cars to my existing network."
1,"That's a lower price point. It allows us to get into some of the community-based hospitals to continue to gain that penetration and share, where we're lower indexed than where we are at the higher end. But we also launched a 3Dimensions, which is at the higher end, the higher price point than our base product."
1,"That's a piece of this that we are factoring going forward is a growing company in animal health. And then the margin expansion is a significant opportunity for animal health and one that the team is very focused on, so all those things are true. I think the analysis, of course, then must ask what's the most valuable path forward for Lilly shareholders to hold, to spend, to partner in some other way and that's still ongoing."
1,That's an area in diabetes and incretin. So in particular where we see opportunities for just continued innovation and raising the bar. And of course we did that once with Trulicity.
1,"That's been achieved over years, if not decades of hard work. And we have very modern infrastructure as well which allows us to provide world's best services and to leverage benefits from our scale and I guess we're fortunate to be in an industry which has strong growth dynamics to it and that includes things like ageing of the population, new tests, especially in genetics and also the ongoing focus on preventative medicine. If we move to slide 4 and just looking at the table first of all, you'll notice that we've presented these results in statutory form rather than constant currency form and the reason for that is that there was minimal FX impact over this half."
1,"That's been important for us. I think where we see opportunities is   and I didn't list it, but we have a slide that at each of the operations, we've identified other things that we can be doing. I talked about Pueblo Viejo as one kind of meaningful example of that, but there's others."
1,"That's important because in the rural areas, a local physician oftentimes will be the referring and treating physician in long-term care. It further allows us to concentrate our long-term care specialty group in the very big metropolitan areas where there is a need to have specialization. So, those are just some of the adjustments that we're doing."
1,"That's one portion. And what that does is it allows us to get back into, one, some fleets that we haven't been into for a while because they didn't like our 13-liter engine, and now that they've had an opportunity to test it, they kind of like it, and they are 13-liter buyers. So we get some consideration from those customers, and even more important, and this is a point that we've made in the past, there's a lot of fleets out there that'll drive two brands, and our portion of their buy has been lower for a period of time."
1,"That's relatively flat to last year, and it remains an area of focus. There are a significant opportunities to expand our share of store brands by launching new products that build upon our core equities in health and beauty while seeking opportunistic growth in other areas, where we can provide customers good value. And as a result of our strength in store brands along with the success of our promotional strategies, front-store gross margin once again improved in the quarter versus a year ago."
1,"That's the opposite of what the media portrays as the problem or writes about the problem in student debt, of high debt balances, but those are the statistics from the Federal Loan Program. We believe that our data, our history and performance here will allow us to identify high-quality borrowers based on a variety of metrics that are beyond   not just credit bureau related that we can expand our offering in the refi space and generate meaningful volume of very, very high quality accounts going forward."
1,That's usually a good sign going into the spring as well as with another large customer that had the same pattern that grew about 10% sequentially. So we see opportunity there.
1,"The  Gold Toes and all the other Gildan items that we've been selling online, that we really haven't been able to service to be honest with you effectively because, a lot of the products were in the Printwear DCs, and truthfully as the branded volume was really more related to innerwear, right So that's going to help us from really from a distribution strategy and then we have a whole IT platform basically of consolidation, which is going to allow us to simplify our investments and our time to drive our IT strategy. And we're going to consolidate back office functionalities that will allow us to reduce SG&A and overhead. So and probably one other area where, I think we really haven't taken full advantage to be honest with you we also do supporting our international brands and not just the ones that we sell from Printwear but also looking at the ones that are really more geared to the consumer market from our branded group so."
1,"The accelerated investment in future-proof connectivity is the key enabler for our business sustainability. Our extensive experience in Spain allows us to industrialize fiber deployment, thus Latam countries now benefit from shorter and more efficient deployments. So, it is not that we're investing less, it is that we are being more efficient in the deployment."
1,"The acquisition is expected to be accretive to adjusted net income per share in 2018 and to GAAP EPS in 2019, reflecting intangible amortization. While the digital automotive advertising market is projected to grow, the acquisition of Dealer Inspire and LDM will allow us to tap into the even faster growing segments of the market. Let's now turn to our specific performance results for the full year and fourth quarter of 2017."
1,"The acquisition of the Well Services Group (sic) [Well Service Group] and Utility Access Solutions significantly expands our service capabilities across markets. The business combination allows us to provide a complementary bundle of products and services to our customers across geographic regions and targeted industry sectors. As discussed previously, this acquisition is yet another catalyst to accelerate our innovation efforts, significantly expanding our touch points with customers and providing invaluable input to further our product research and development efforts."
1,"The acquisition was completed this month and fits perfectly into our well-segmented family of brands as a new construction economy extended-stay brand. Heading into 2018, we see opportunity in this segment. Extended-stay has reported some of the most impressive gains in demand and led the hospitality industry in annual RevPAR growth in 2017, with the strongest gains coming from economy extended-stay."
1,"The answer is we're always assessing the portfolio. So if we see opportunities to redeploy the capital into new projects then we'll probably accelerate some of those. But like I said, we're always assessing the portfolio to say what's the best suit for the long-term."
1,"The assessment has involved a more thorough review of the business to identify areas of further improvement to sustain improvements already made and determine the steps necessary to realize the company's full earnings potential. We're very encouraged with the findings to-date, which reinforce our thinking that significant opportunities exist to reduce costs and further enhance margins through improved efficiency, process, productivity, and alignment. We're now taking action to streamline functions, increase automation, improve processes, optimize the footprint in our distribution network, and enhance pricing and sourcing activities."
1,"The base isn't going away, the base business isn't going away, so we need to find ways to make sure that we can make that more profitable, that we can have a recurring revenue stream tied to that, which is with flaws. And then I think the CloudLink capability is very unique because it allows us to really introduce to a non-cloud oriented customer base, productivity applications. And that's what it's all about at the end of the day."
1,"The BLA for our next potential commercial product, pegvaliase, was filed last June, and we look forward to the PDUFA outcome in late May. The PKU markets represent a significant opportunity as we have seen with KUVAN. And Jeff will walk us through these plans and our plans for launch execution of commercial pegvaliase in the U."
1,"The Brink opportunity is very compelling from both a strategic and financial standpoint. With the acquisition, Horizon Global will expand its competitive position as a leading solution provider in the towing and trailering industry, with scale that will allow us to more effectively service our customer needs. This acquisition is expected to have a long-term positive financial impact on our company, given Brink's manufacturing innovation, expertise and efficiencies to lower costs."
1,"The business continues its strategy of maximizing value through the sales of operationally proven projects. However, we maintain an interest in a number of projects where we see opportunities to the wider group. In total, Â£105 million of proceeds were received in 2017."
1,"The business is performing well, meeting and exceeding the goals, which is fantastic. As far as the synergies on the top line, we're still working through the system integration like we talked about before, so we haven't achieved all the revenue synergies that we would hope for to-date, but we do see significant opportunities to achieve the expected revenue synergies once we consolidate the systems in North America. From an expense standpoint, we didn't really call out expense being a major synergistic area in this transaction."
1,"The Cardium is shallow, sweet, and liquids-rich, and we have abundant opportunity, much of which is directly under our existing infrastructure. It's taking a few years, but now it finally appears that improvements to drilling and completion technology will allow us to realize much more of the potential we've recognized in this play for a long time."
1,"The center was developed to an eight-plus yield generating value creation of over $25 million and is 100% leased. A strong merchandising mix, place making and connection with the community allows us to drive foot traffic, increase dwell time, leading to higher tenant sales and ultimately driving NOI growth."
1,"The Chief Commercial Officer, I think was clearly a high value hire for us and I think he is here, because he recognizes the opportunity that both Iomab and potentially Actimab-MDS bring to Actinium over the next three years. But I think clearly myeloablation is an area that we understand pretty well more than anybody else I think as a company and the ARC technology certainly allows us to do things other companies cannot with the CD33 program in that area, the CLAG-M being case in point, Actimab-MDS case in point. I would ask for those of you that are able, please listen in to our product showcase at the BMT Tandem Meeting, you might get some more nuggets a lot, but certainly the DNA of the company is changing now and focused on an area that is truly unfulfilled in the area of bone marrow transplant."
1,"The combination creates a compelling platform for Graphic Packaging to grow in SBS foodservice and folding carton converting organically and through acquisitions. Looking ahead to 2018, we see a solid pipeline of acquisition opportunities that will allow us to further integrate our SBS mills and increase our scale in SBS foodservice and folding carton converting. Our focus is on acquisition opportunities in North America and in Europe."
1,"The combination delivers more than just meaningful benefits to healthcare, but also meaningful benefits to stockholders. Very specifically, the benefits to healthcare achieves the vertical integration of which we've spoken, the cloud-based platform enablement of value-based care and expands on the datasets and analytics and connectivity capability and improved reach that allows us to go through the entire vertical nature of the stack of healthcare. In addition to the benefits of healthcare, it drives a significant number of benefits to stockholders and there are many."
1,"The combination of our two companies makes us the clear irrigation leader in the east and provides good purchasing synergies, as well as cross-selling opportunities. As we turn to slide 16, we continue to see a significant opportunity to grow profitably through acquisitions, which allow us to move into new markets, extend our presence in existing ones, broaden our product offering, and also, very importantly, add outstanding talent to our team. Our pipeline remains robust and with two acquisitions year-to-date, our M&A strategy is gaining momentum, and we continue to build a reputation as the buyer choice in the industry."
1,"The combination of strong upsell and lower growth churn resulted in higher overall net retention. In fact, our annualized net retention for mid-market and enterprise business was about 130%, underscoring the significant opportunity we are capturing. Last year, we used $1 million TCV deals as an approximation of our progress in the enterprise segment."
1,"The combined company will have enhanced geographic diversity and specialty capabilities as well as new opportunities to accelerate growth. With regards to the financial impact, we expect this transaction to be immediately accretive to earnings and that it will allow us to realize significant cost synergies and cash flow. Additionally, BlueLinx has commitments from Wells Fargo and Bank of America to a range of $750 million ABL Revolver inclusive of a $150 million accordion feature and a commitment from HPS Partners for a $180 million term loan to fund the acquisition and provide solid liquidity for our future working capital needs."
1,"The company is the number three North American chlor-alkali producer and number two PVC producer in North America. This position allows us to benefit from greater scale and synergies, a better position amidst global competition through chain integration, greater ability to serve customers and capitalize on future investment opportunities and a broader geographical footprint that includes both our German Vinnolit business and Chinese Huasu business that I'd mentioned. We'll look at the German business, Vinnolit here on the next slide."
1,"The demands associated with renewing our large, long-term managed learning service contracts, implementing a more efficient and effective ERP system, and establishing a structured sales process are very significant, but these efforts lay the foundation for significant growth for GP Strategies. We're facing challenges in some aspects of the business, but other areas are revealing significant opportunities. Our UK business is still adapting to some changes to the UK Government's funding model for job skills training, which requires us to shift our customer engagement model."
1,"The diversity of the APOLLO patient demographic highlights significant potential for commercial opportunities in Central and Eastern Europe and in markets like Asia Pacific and Latin America. Now, while not in APOLLO, we also see significant opportunities in the Middle East in countries like Turkey, Israel and United Arab Emirates. Our build of the Alnylam commercial and medical customer facing organization is well underway."
1,"The doubling of profit is occurring on schedule, but tripling and quadrupling is requiring growth in leadership, better utilization of technology, and inspired teams to achieve the expected result. As we demonstrated in our investor presentation, we see opportunity for significant dry powder in each business line. More specifically, new vehicle sales at acquisitions averaged 30% below the market share expected by our manufacturers and 50% below our seasoned stores."
1,"The drivers for growth of our SaaS recurring revenue are coming from demand for alarm communication, which includes the Connected Home category as well as the Internet-of-Things. We continue to see significant opportunity in school safety and security market. The total addressable market is very large with 100,000 K-12 and 10,000 colleges and universities in the U."
1,"The facility which opened in November of 2016 joins the current Ensign assets comprised of 16 skilled nursing facilities located in Texas. Turning to our pipeline, we see opportunity to grow with both new and existing customers. The prospects for new investment remain healthy with a large amount of private pay senior housing opportunities under review."
1,"The federal opportunity opening with FedRAMP is to make sure that base continues to grow and provides a growth platform for the company which new products and the CEM suite can accelerate total growth then, because it's not replacing revenue, it's purely additive. And ultimately, the international revenue and the partnership potentially with the UMS allows us to sustain that core mass notification base. So, the strategy all along has been keep that growing at current growth trajectory or slightly better and then, go after these new product areas with the new products in CEM to substantially accelerate us into   in the last year I think roughly 30% plus."
1,"The financial benefit of doing this, our ATG costs don't go down when we move stuff to satellite, but we're freeing up capacity on the ATG network. It allows us to continue to grow the BA business and maintain high service levels. It will allow us to increase the take rate on the regional jets and the other aircraft that remain on the ATG network."
1,"The first is that, as you know, if you're manufacturing prior to approval, then that's treated from an accounting point of view differently. So, given that we had a long-term life expected for the   shelf life expected for the drug, in excess, we believe, of two years at the time of launch that allows us to begin manufacturing now and get out in front of this so that we're prepared for whatever the launch curve may look like. I will tell you that we think the   we're excited about the prospects and we know that will be the first approved therapy if that happens."
1,"The first of our three initiatives within portfolio expansion is progression of our 3 millimeter instrument sets. Our open architecture strategy allows us to quickly expand our offerings to take advantage of technology as acceptance grows. While most laparoscopic procedures are done today using 5 millimeter instruments, we are seeing increasing use of 3 millimeter instruments as surgeons continue to push the boundaries of minimally invasive surgery."
1,"The first quarter is more notably different, for sure, because it's more positively impacted by the shift. Prior-year comps, in general, we haven't found to be good indicators of future performance and if future performance is typically driven more by the key initiatives that the company has and so, as I said, there's a certain note of optimism I'm sure you're hearing about those sales because customer acquisition has improved, our product initiatives are working, our inventory is in phenomenal shape, which allows us to flow fresh and new receipts into our stores, and the combination of these other investments in technology and personalization we think are going to drive new business. Particularly to the holiday, I'll let Michelle take that."
1,"The first question in the interest of time what I can say is that, we think that having both directly modulated lasers or DML which tend to be lower cost, but limited to relatively shorter distances than EMLs or electro-absorption modulated lasers. We think they're having both directly modulated laser technology and electro-absorption modulated technology, allows us to cover the widest range of distances within the datacenter. And in fact, in the case of EMLs between data centers and even in some telecom markets which is where we're currently   we don't have a large business in the telecom market."
1,"The first thing is that we've changed out the radiation source, so that it has a lower energy around 20 kV, which provides Grenz rays, G-R-E-N-Z, which allows for the treatment of psoriasis. The second major component of that is our manufacturing team, R&D team manufacture or we will be able to manufacture it at a slightly lower cost which will allow us to or help us with our margin."
1,"The gardein performance reflects the benefit of the new Hagerstown, Maryland, facility that significantly expanded capacity for the brand. We continue to believe that growth of plant-based proteins represent a very significant opportunity and gardein is poised as a leader in the space to benefit meaningfully. To ensure continued momentum of Boulder, we are introducing a full slate of innovation behind the portfolio, including our recently introduced Udi's white and multigrain sandwich bread made with a new formula that dramatically improves the taste and texture of gluten-free offerings in the market."
1,"The Gathering Portal. Portal will allow us to connect with the tens of millions of tabletop players of Magic, while giving them terrific functionality to make playing Magic at home as fun as in one of our over one million tournaments and in-store play events that happen every year. Portal joined several other exciting games we have in development like the recently announced Project M, a mobile player versus player strategy game from one of the biggest publishers in this space, Netmarble."
1,"The group remains in a strong financial position with net cash of Â£4 million although we have circa Â£50 million of cash tied up in the business any point in time, including cash flows, moneys in transit or clearing, and customer balances. Our brands continue to generate strong cash flow with EBITDA of over Â£130 million in the last 12 months, and our low level of committed CapEx allows us to flex expenditure up or down quickly. This provides significant balance sheet capacity for any opportunities that may arise."
1,"The income tax paid during the year was â‚¬121 million pretty much in line with the taxes recorded in our P&L. We have spent â‚¬105 million in CapEx, in addition to improve in the security and showing of our branches in LatAm, we have also accelerated the growth of our retail automation business which at the end of the day is continues as it allows us to keep growing and transforming our company. The increase in working capital for the whole year was â‚¬11 million remaining under control."
1,"The industrial market, which is probably our least niche if you think of it as a bit more general of the market, we're expecting flat, and primarily, that's self-induced. I think the industrial market is moving along at a steady pace at the moment, which helps us and it allows us to really restructure our focus there to make sure that we're focusing with our best products and our best customers to make that business better than it's been in the past. So with that we're going to have a flat year."
1,"The initial results are encouraging and we believe that our position, scale and over 40-year history of operating EOR projects provide OXY with an advantage that will be extremely difficult to replicate. Progressing this technology will allow us to incorporate EOR into our future development plans and realize value with this upside option beyond just primary recovery. We're excited about these pilots and the future opportunity they represent."
1,"The integration of the pharmacy business has created further significant revenue and cost synergy opportunities. The pharma business is important growth opportunity for the group and it will allow us to further diversify our earnings profile and revenues as well. So, in completing of my comments, 2017 was a year of good progress for GHG."
1,"The ITV Hub delivers a high-quality, trusted and measured environment for advertisers. It allows us to build direct to consumer relationships around our great content and our program brands, something we are just at the beginning of. But already we have 75% of all 16 to 34 year olds registered."
1,"The key driver behind our performance continues to be our highly flexible mine plan, a highly variable cost structure in areas like labor, royalties and logistics and a clean balance sheet. This allows us to provide for an agile operational response to movements in the Australian premium low-vol hard coking coal index price and take advantage of market conditions opportunistically. Our sales volume for the fourth quarter was 1."
1,The key markets out of the South are both China and India. And we think there is significant opportunity to grow those markets going forward.
1,"The key to this approach is to maximize the company market penetration, while protecting Hydrogenics proprietary technology something that we take very seriously. And by having the right connections in China, we feel confident that our strategy will result in improved product positioning, built on quality, reliability and broad customer testing and acceptance. Overall, we remain very upbeat about the Chinese market and the opportunity that it holds even with recent changes in regulations impacting certain incentives as shown on slide 5."
1,"The last adjustment to our strategic plan that I'll mention today is increasing our priorities and efforts to achieve operating efficiencies. The company has experienced tremendous growth in recent years and, as a result, there are several areas where we see opportunities to further improve efficiencies, increase the output of our plants to support recently and soon to be approved products. I'll now turn to our financial results."
1,"The launch and subsequent progress has exceeded our expectations, and we see that there is very strong demand from both suppliers and users. As such, we see a very significant opportunity for Pando and hence we have increased and brought forward our investments into this area. We'll, therefore, be putting significant resources behind Pandao through 2018 as we materially further expand marketing, content, and distribution."
1,"The loan to value is just over 50% at the moment, has come down and we'll   we see of course and we'd like to have the loan to value under 50% that is very close to it, that is one thing. But the most important driver is that we see opportunity for   to acquire hotels. And as you know, we have done acquisition for SEK 17 billion over the last three years, and that is still a good market for it."
1,The location is immediately adjacent to the Garden of the Gods Park in Colorado Springs. The new facility allows us to offer what today's top talent seeks in a work in a workplace. We are extremely excited for the significant upgrade and refresh.
1,"The majority of these senior bankers will be focused on driving C&I relationships in Southeast Michigan, Grand Rapids and Cleveland, and will help sustain our strong loan growth and loan mix initiative. The investments we're making will increase our operating expense run rate going forward, but more importantly, it will enhance our overall long-term growth prospects and will allow us to deliver on the goals that were established as a part of the Chemical and Talmer merger. With that, let me turn it over to Dennis to go through the financial results in detail."
1,"The market conditions are aggressive, and we are working very hard to make sure that every deal that we book is a strong credit that can withstand a downturn in the economy if a downturn does occur. So we're sticking to our credit philosophies, but we have ramped up our origination efforts, and it's that larger pipeline of deals that will allow us to continue to increase diversity in the BDC as we go on through 2018."
1,"The market is fragmented, tends to be focused on the mainstream and a terrific opportunity for some of our products like Syrox, and you can learn more about that at the break outside. And our strength in distribution in Europe really is a differentiator and allows us to move across the region with these. What you see here in China is you see a shift happening in the market."
1,"The merger of Archrock and Archrock Partners is an important step toward improving our credit profile, significantly reducing our need for equity capital, enhancing our dividend coverage, and lowering our cost of capital. Additionally, the transaction will allow us to retain additional capital to invest in a robust opportunity set of organic growth projects. First, I want to provide some background on how this transaction came about."
1,"The more the company transacts the more revenues we generate. So, what I want you to take away from the slide is that we would want to earn revenues out of every transaction, which is a significant opportunity to scale-up the company. Next, I would like you to understand GeM slightly better from us."
1,"The new Justice loyalty program Club Justice has signed up over 2. 6 million members since its launch this past October and we are already seeing the impact of this program with increased customer frequency and we're pleased with the transaction we're seeing at this brand and believe we have significant opportunity in front of us to recapture some of the volume that has been lost over the past three years. At Lane Bryant, we've seen nice improvement on our apparel business, which has been the drag on brand's performance for an extended period."
1,"The next category is products and enablers, which increased 28% year-over-year. This spend allows us to develop enhanced functionality and a more robust product suite for both our residential and B2B customers. And then, finally, we had a modest increase in our baseline capital spend, where we've been proactively choosing to accelerate certain investments in core areas of our infrastructure."
1,"The only thing I will add and I mean just to reaffirm what Melissa said, on the near term, I mean we feel very, very good about what we have been doing and the tax reform didn't prevent us from doing that. Obviously, as we look on the long-term, the tax reduction will allow us to compete more effectively across the globe and the free cash flow generation will allow us to have more open options on what do we want to do with our capital allocation."
1,The Onsite creates a little challenge for it. But I'll take that challenge because it allows us to grow in Onsites in attractive business from the standpoint of our ability to grow with it and our ability to generate return.
1,"The opportunities may include international markets for emerging global diseases, quantitative biology, digital health and personalized medicine, just to name a few. This is an exciting time for OraSure, and I believe there are a number of potentially significant opportunities that we can and should pursue in the future. Another important area I want to mention is our organization."
1,"The opportunity is to create a customer experience using our technology stack at a pace that others would struggle to do to make customers' lives easier. And my view is open banking will allow us to do things for mortgage customers, for business customers where we can do things for them that make their lives easier that they value."
1,"The orders were placed by a long-standing customer and are expected to be shipped in the first and second quarter. So, looking forward, we enter the year well positioned for growth and we continue to see significant opportunities. We're in an era of technological change, with disruptive technologies that are growing at higher rates than traditional markets driven by a quest for manufacturing efficiencies, the flow of data, connectivity and mobility."
1,"The other big thing you're seeing around the digitization efforts is what's happening with the digital sales. We're building out a whole system that not only allows us to transact digitally, which is nice, and you saw from Scott, the impact that's going to have on our realization over a multi-year period, but we're building out a system that allows us to understand how to help those customers that we're bringing in digitally, help them buy more, help them get more out of the solution and ultimately renew more effectively. So, those are some of the things that are already showing up in terms of the digitization efforts of the company."
1,"The other element of our business when markets are strong and there is a lot of investment going in to biotech, we find our licensing rate increases as well. So, partners are coming to us, looking to license our technology, so that they can add to their pipeline, given that they've got more opportunities for investment, so there is actually a very nice balance in our model, both in times when we see opportunities to buy companies that may have stumbled or may have a technology that we think could have real value, but also in periods where there is a lot of investment going in to R&D pipelines, we are finding our licensing rate increases as well."
1,"The other one that is somewhat incremental to previous years is Sprint kind of revisiting and returning to network spend and investment. We are seeing activity levels with them increase as well and we feel confident that they definitely will be spending on their networks certainly well beyond what they've done over the last few years, which wasn't much. And so, those are both incremental opportunities as we move into the year."
1,"The other thing to know is that each one of these area provides a significant upgrade to the current construction method that exists and it also happens to be in areas where we don't have a huge market penetration. So we have this significant opportunity to gain market share in these areas with these innovative products to hopefully and expect   we expect to significantly outpace the growth of the industry. So, with that, here are our four product focus areas."
1,"The pancreas cancer indication has successfully cleared several de-risking events with a projected timeline to start data analysis just months away at the end of this year. Success in pancreas cancer represents a large opportunity for Halozyme and this may be only the beginning with multiple other tumors we're evaluating representing additional significant opportunity. And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Laurie to discuss the financial results in greater detail."
1,"The patient insights are strong. On top of that, ALXN1210 hopefully will allow us to have a subcu formulation once a week or even longer than that. So, we believe that with non-inferiority we have, we will be in a great position to have a facilitated conversion from Soliris to ALXN1210 for PNH and aHUS and raise the bar."
1,"The plants are expected to supply roughly 70% over future power requirements, thus locking in a key cost component. In addition, this also allows us to benefit from Brazilian legislation that reduces tariffs to companies that generate their own power supply. These tariff savings represent approximately $15 of the expected $80 per ounce savings."
1,"The primary use of cash continues to be to support organic growth in the business. We're excited about the significant opportunities we've identified in our businesses and continue to invest appropriately. We then layer in a sensitivity analysis regarding potential M&A as well as CapEx, in particular, computing infrastructure to support the needs of these growing businesses."
1,"The reality is that Terex has historically been more focused on the original equipment sales as opposed to parts and services. We see a significant opportunity to grow the top and bottom line of the company through a more focused effort in parts and services. From a financial perspective, Terex is about a $5-billion company."
1,"The reason that's better measure is, in real time, you have salespeople going out and seeing customers all the time signing up on depths. So, yes, we have share and that share continues to grow, and that continues to be significant opportunity."
1,The remarkable progress we have experienced in this area over the last three years evidences our company's commitment to match our client transformation processes and to provide the best customer experience in the digital world. Our goal is to continue to lead this path since we see significant opportunities ahead in higher value-added solutions and digital. Please turn to page 6.
1,"The results of our Moorefield tests have de-risked approximately 36,000 productive net acres out of the prospective 100,000 acres in the play. Additionally, we identified a significant opportunity for additional future value through the redevelopment of the Fayetteville Shale, utilizing the latest generation drilling and completion techniques supported by our internal big data analytics. The redevelopment opportunities include both re-drilling infill wells in older, lower performing areas of the field and drilling normally spaced, proved undeveloped locations, again using the latest drilling and completions technology and in some cases extending lateral lengths."
1,"The second area of opportunity is to purchase existing industrial gas facilities from our customers where we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee under a long-term contract. This is what we call asset buybacks, and we see opportunities for oxygen and hydrogen plants around the world in this category. We also see the opportunity to expand our scope of supply to include the operation of existing gasification units to supply syngas to our customers based on long-term contracts."
1,"The second is that capital allocation is going to be largely focused on organic growth across all of our platforms. We're going to over indexed on the commercial bank and wealth management both Canada and the United States where we see significant opportunities for continued growth and we're going to continue to focus, this is the third important point on getting our efficiency ratio down to the competitive level that we foresee getting to a steady state of 55% over the course of the next year and working toward a 52% mix ratio by 2022. So to ramp up we've got a strong leadership in place team in place."
1,"The second is that capital allocation is going to be largely focused on organic growth across all of our platforms. We're going to over-index on the Commercial Bank and Wealth Management, both Canada and the United States where we see significant opportunities for continued growth. And we're going to continue to focus."
1,"The second is that we are implementing different operational   operating initiatives to improve the profitability of the business in line with our market peers. And thirdly, we have seen that as mentioned in the Western Road Upgrade project that there is significant opportunity to add value combining Broadspectrum and local knowledge with Ferrovial differential capabilities. With this we end the presentation."
1,The setup of the country category business teams result in better alignment between the countries and the categories and help us to ensure that category strategies are implemented very well at country level in the front line of our business. The integration of Foods and Refreshment allows us to further sharpen the organization and the resources required for that business to compete with the very best food and nutrition businesses in the world. We've also redesigned all of our functions.
1,"The smart products, how do we become more innovative, how do we really deliver a package solution to our customers, which at the end of the day, as the last point says, we want to be more of a solution-based selling business. And that means, we need to have the right engineering team, we need to have the right resources, we have the right focus   being more market focus will allow us to do that more effectively. So, moving forward, I'm very excited to be part of the global ESS team, I think that we've got a great group of people."
1,"The SP&S group will continue to develop and launch new products and grow its sales network of distributors. The third business pillar, the O&M, will become more and more a catalyst to sales synergies with other pillars and will allow us to establish strong presence in promising geographies such as Alberta and Texas. Altogether, our business is in good shape."
1,"The Stern Drive is really a program that allows us to continue to expand the margins similar to what we had in the past. It touches different topics, it touches productivity topics, it touches on material cost savings."
1,"The system order is the latest example of our success in the independent utility market segment and we look forward to future contributions from similar opportunities. We've worked hard to create a business model that allows us to execute it across diverse markets. We've introduced new products such as the Matrix, the DER SuperModule and the DER Flex Advanced internet of energy control system all of which provide us the product flexibility to address these divergent markets."
1,"The systems look cute and small but if you actually look at what you need to go from sample to inside, it becomes, in many cases, quite a nightmare. And so, removing that complexity allows us to lower the price and the degrees of freedom are lower, the validation requirements at the labs are reduced. And this allows the sample to inside price, the all-in price, to be substantially lower than what competition is able to offer."
1,"The teams continue to capture share as they lean into favorable market trends. The demand for affordable, results-oriented healthcare, in concert with the evolving technology needs being requested from the consumer packaging market, allows us to post strong double-digit growth, thus providing an awfully bright outlook and sustained momentum. Our healthcare and packaging businesses are profoundly integral to our story as we aim for greater economic stability throughout the Jabil enterprise."
1,The teams have completely reengineered our financial plans to architect a much more consistent in even receipt flow going forward. This will allow us to work with lower average inventory levels in our boutiques with minimal back stock driving more goods from door to floor. This approach also reduces workload for our stores and more importantly gets new product in front of our guests on a much more rapid basis.
1,"The terms of the facility are similar to previous syndicated facilities. The refinancing will allow us to maintain strong liquidity while lengthening the average tenure of our debt to almost three years. The new debt facility will provide the group with additional flexibility and liquidity to meet working capital and strategic growth requirements, including coverage for the U."
1,"The thing that I love about the acquisition is it plays to our strength, our wheel house. We're really good at optimizing companies and we believe that the advantages we get from a broader portfolio, the fact that we're going to be able to leverage a much broader base of R&D and innovation, what it allows us to do from a manufacturing footprint standpoint and certainly expand the channels where we're good today. But we have the potential to really expand the breadth of our portfolio to reach consumers is really exciting for us."
1,"The third evolution in security which we're just launching is our Application Framework. And what this does is it allows us to leverage that platform, that consistent security provisioning across your entire ecosystem, your entire environment. And it allows us to leverage the vast data lakes that we've been amassing through wildfire and through all of our security infrastructure for a number of years now."
1,"The use of the SeaRose is what makes this project unique. It allows us to go ahead and have an economic project with good returns at low oil prices when many or most, a large number of the offshore oil projects around the world are still challenged at those sort of price levels. In Asia, growth in Indonesia and sanction of the latest field at Liuhua 29-1, which we sanctioned late last year, will lead to production growth of 50% over the five-year plan period."
1,"The UTD business has a strong backlog of primarily MSA revenue, and this is in line with our strategic goal of increasing our MSA revenue to provide a stable base from which we can continue to grow. We see opportunities to expand the MSA contracts with a number of our key existing customers and create additional opportunities for distribution, transmission crews and storm restoration work. While traditional transmission and distribution markets remain strong, we are also seeing increased demand for renewables and overall strong increasing demand for electrical transmission and distribution."
1,"There are   there is private equity; there are large operators that compete in this market. But we   you know, we feel confident and certainly working hard with that management teams to look at opportunities."
1,"There are a number of levers for achieving this second objective. First, our sourcing breadth allows us to be highly selective and focused on quality deployment opportunities. Based on our dialogue with corporates and sponsors, it remains clear that there's great demand for lenders capable of offering holistic solutions across the capital structure."
1,"There are a number of other initiatives going on. Obviously, the NG-PON2, which we can talk more about, where we feel very well-positioned on that, we think that's going to be a very significant opportunity going forward over a 5 to 10-year period across a number of applications, not just a the current application that Verizon is talking about for low-cost internet. But we've talked on multiple occasions about it being a catalyst for 5G fixed wireless and 5G backhaul deployments."
1,"There are compelling opportunities still available to us at Tractor Supply to grow, not only our comparable sales, but our profitability. At Tractor, we see again significant opportunity for new store growth in both formats Tractor Supply and Petsense. And we are leveraging today the physical assets with the digital aspects to grow our sales overall."
1,"There are four main geographies that we focus on. With these four investment unit, it allows us to invest across all asset classes within each geography. That means each team on the ground has now been able to look at the opportunities holistically and not only for a specific asset classes."
1,"There are significant operational improvement opportunities at our disposal. Capturing these opportunities allows us to stabilize and then start improving our results, while planning for and investing in the future. We are disappointed in our fiscal 2019 outlook, but feel it is important to have this year as a transition year to kick off our transformation plan."
1,"There are some opportunities there. I want to leave you with the impression and that's a correct impression that the opportunities, the demand and our opportunity in immunology as I can see it   and again, I can only see of course with the eyes that I look at is a significant opportunity. And what I like about immunology is when the constraints are something that you have control over, I like that, the constraints here are not global demand, the constraints is not participating in tenders around the world, the constraints is not you don't have the right portfolio."
1,"There are still some deals that are cooking here. And as we already said several times, we see opportunities for about 11 to 13 different production lines over the next few years. I would say that probably between OLED and LCD, we see a lot of activities in OLED."
1,"There is increasing evidence to support the significant impact of chronically elevated uric acid on other body systems, including hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Our data indicates there are approximately 50,000 uncontrolled gout patients currently treated by nephrologists, providing a significant opportunity to accelerate the number of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA, doubling the addressable patient population to approximately 100,000 in the United States. Given that we treated less than 2% of the addressable patient market in 2017, we see considerable opportunity with our recently expanded commercial team to rapidly and substantially grow our share of this market over the coming years."
1,"There were some regions which we're interested to expand upon, there're also some opportunities for us which we would need to think about whether we have the capacity and whether the Hansen dialog or fundamental rules the way we operate our business will translate into that region. So we see opportunities in many countries around the world which all look a bit like Hansen and we've seen some of our team to go there and look at those opportunities, but   so that's some of our medium term. In the short-term, we're always talking to someone at the moment now."
1,"There will be no incremental value to the Sponsors from Capital Dynamics in respect of their ownership of the general partner of the Partnership, or incentive distribution rights in 8point3 Operating Company, LLC. An important element to any transaction is certainty of closing, and with committed financing already in place from Capital Dynamics, we feel confident that they will consummate this transaction. Additionally, the transaction has been unanimously approved by the Conflicts Committee of our general partner's board of directors, as well as approved by the Partnership's board of directors."
1,"There will be no negative impact on customers or suppliers, and there will be no TTV lost as a result of this plan. Our expectation is this will allow us to really to start growth at a stronger level in the Australian Leisure market than we have over the last few years. The transformation plans have been very focused on brand, business, and platforms but I want to also let you know we continue to invest in our people which are at the core of our success story in nearly all of our brands."
1,"There's also a growing parental involvement in helping students apply, enroll and persist in college, which provides a B2C opportunity for us. Monetizing consumers will allow us to increase our customer base, expand our market and drive revenue growth. We are also seeing a trend to prove out the ROI of an education."
1,"There's also as I mentioned prior things that we expect operate at kind of a shared autonomy fleet where Tesla's kind of like a combination of Uber or Lyft and Airbnb, I guess, like where you can opt to have your car enter a shared fleet or not, and then Tesla can also operate its own fleet in places where there's not enough people sharing their vehicles. So that's a pretty significant opportunity."
1,"There's going to be a continued shift toward premium, I've said it several times, it is going to continue and it presents an opportunity for profitable growth. The investment in Ceilings Plus allows us to win in the marketplace and our customers to win in the marketplace. With USG Ensemble we've met the long sought after need architects and designers have for acoustical drywall, and we are well-positioned now to take advantage of that opportunity."
1,"There's less than 10% of vehicles in North America and around about 5% of vehicles globally are currently using climate control seating technologies. So, I think that provides us significant opportunities, especially over the coming years, as more and more vehicles get really serious about emissions, regulations and transitioning to electrification. So, that's an area you'll see a lot of focus on."
1,"There's more work to do, but we believe this is a good starting point for 2018 free cash flow. Ending the factoring program was the right decision and will allow us to save on interest cost and improve operating cash flow performance in 2018. We expect to collect over 75% of the receivables we didn't factor in the first quarter and for this not to impact 2018."
1,"There's one other customer has 26 sites, we're about to get one of them, and our history is we go in and we perform well, service, we bring a lot of technology and visibility that a lot of our competitors in that segment does not have. And so that will allow us to capture even more in that. So we think we're ready."
1,"These achievements illustrate our focus and ability to deliver value to both our customers and shareholders. I will now discuss some of the trends we are seeing across our end markets, which will continue to expand the significant opportunities for our business in the years ahead. At Mobile World Congress recently, phone manufacturers featured high-end smartphones with larger 4K displays, multiple high-resolution cameras, and 4K HDR video recording."
1,"These are big markets for us that we serve today. And so, we're going to serve them in a more convenient way for guests, and it allows us to move capacity around in Sea-Tac for other markets that we want to put metal in, because it's getting constrained."
1,"These are fundamental drivers of our success, and we will continue to invest behind and live up to our D&I aspirations, build on our accelerated programs and foster a culture that is both entrepreneurial and accountable. This is what allows us to attract the best people, whether they're traditional craft practitioners or they represent the most leading edge technological capabilities. We all know that our industry is changing rapidly."
1,"These are the trends driven by technology like electrification, artificial intelligence, driverless cars, advanced robotics and we embrace it at AutoCanada and we intend to play a significant role in the retail space as it does change over the next 10 years. This will allow us to adapt our business to the face of complex dynamics in a changing industry. So with that, we'd like to open the line to questions."
1,"These changes I think will make us quicker with better quality and broader capabilities to penetrate deeper into our customer supply chain. We feel confident that we're better prepared than ever to be a resource to our customers, all the way from the alloy design and specification to parts manufacture and processing for their components. Also, perhaps less strategic and more on the tactical side of the execution, I think you know these large capital upgrade projects are difficult to manage and, at times, disruptive to material flow and continuity of the business."
1,"These channels enable us to reach existing and potential guests more frequently and in a more cost-effective manner. Additionally, digital marketing allows us to be nimble with our promotions and react to trends more quickly. And of course, we always look to grow our PLCC and multi-tender loyalty programs."
1,"These commercial divisions are supported and coordinated by other perpendicular functions such as technology, supply chain and procurement, finance and human resources to make sure we capture synergies and have the right level of coordination. I strongly believe this new structure will allow us to take our different formats to the next level, and to improve the quality of service we provide to our customers. Moving on to page 40, improving efficiency is always a priority for DIA."
1,"These decreases were partially offset by an increase in G&A investment, with the largest contributor being our previously discussed core IT infrastructure migration to a cloud-based system. As we discussed last quarter, the investment in our IT infrastructure builds a more scalable foundation and will allow us to automate the growing demands of our business. As compared to last quarter, our operating expenses were essentially flat, even with the expenses associated with the company's Annual User Group in October and the increased commissions associated with Q4 results."
1,"These five stores will bring our total store count to 92 stores across 23 states at the end of fiscal 2018 and will represent 3% square footage growth over fiscal year 2017. This prudent moderation from 2017's 12 store openings will allow us to allocate more free cash flow to pay down debt. Of the five stores, two will be our smaller format 15,000 square foot stores, a flexible store format that provides us with the opportunity to reach customers in smaller markets that are more insulated from our destination based competitors."
1,"These improvements resulted in a reduced number of escalation calls to our care center and higher customer satisfaction metrics, as our customers received their orders more quickly and with more visibility during delivery. While we see significant opportunity to further optimize our inventory, there has been a notable improvement for in-stock service levels and reduced local market out-of-stocks across the company. All these accomplishments are underpinned by our company culture and values, which have long defined the way we operate."
1,"These include opportunities to co-locate offices for the combined employee base, optimizing structure of common corporate operations, aligning organizational structures to drive efficiencies, consolidating and migrating systems including IT, and implementing best practices across organizations to do our work as effectively and efficiently as possible. In addition to the cost synergies, we see opportunities for meaningful revenue growth. When thinking about the combination of our Underground and Layne's Inliner divisions, we see tremendous opportunity to further vertically integrate."
1,"These investments will cover some labor rate increases, shelter team members from an increase in medical premiums and improve other team member benefits. Additionally, this allows us to proactively invest in wages to stay ahead of future minimum wage rate increases in certain markets. As Sprouts is a full U."
1,"These patients would be available immediately at launch for treatment with fedratinib. We believe fedratinib represents a significant opportunity for patients and has the potential to be $1-billion blockbuster for Celgene. The acquisition of Juno Therapeutics will strengthen our position as a leader in cellular immunotherapy, and will allow us to capitalize on future advances in this important scientific field."
1,These products will enable users to experience through Multi-Gig connectivity by using dongles and innovative docking stations designed to connect to high performance multi-gigabit networks in the office or on the road. Our success with major North American PC OEMs allows us to extend our reach even farther to the edge of the Enterprise network. These systems are all available today and shipping in volume.
1,"These relationships enable us to experiment with new analytics products and service lines in a cost-effective manner, helping us to develop new business models across verticals, geographies, and functional domains. Our package-agnostic approach to partnering allows us to evaluate and develop the best possible solutions for our clients. The third area of new analytics-based offerings comes from our recent acquisitions."
1,"These results are proof of strategic plan that is working. It allows us to leverage our exceptional global scale to create long-term value and free up dollars to invest back into the business. In fact, over the last two years, in addition to our integration initiatives, we've also directed significant efforts and dollars in innovation to drive long-term growth."
1,"These shares were repurchased under the $200 million share repurchase program announced in 2016. As a reminder, this program allows us to repurchase shares opportunistically from time-to-time, and we believe doing so will enhance long-term shareholder value. The repurchase authorization does not have a fixed expiration date."
1,"These statements may contain expectations regarding revenues, earnings, operations, and other results, and may include statements of future performance, plans and objectives. Forward-looking statements include statements pertaining to, among other things, the commercial launch and demand for the Accelerate Pheno system and Accelerate PhenoTest BC kit for positive blood cultures, the potential benefits of the Accelerate Pheno system and Accelerate PhenoTest BC kit including accelerated identification and susceptibility results and estimates of time reduction to results, expectations on placements, sales, and product profitability, the potential of our technology generally, our belief that our expanded manufacturing capability will allow us to meet demand, our expectation of our 2017 and 2018 performance, and our future development plans and growth strategy including with respect to research and development as well as product expansion. These statements represent only our belief regarding future events, many of which are inherently uncertain."
1,"These will be included starting in 2018. We believe this advanced intelligent automation will allow us to improve our clients' experience, our service quality and our competitive position, while also improving our cost to serve. We also believe these improvements around automation, AI and productivity rates are important structural changes that will position us to drive ongoing improvements in profitability within Services in the near-term and create further upside to optimize the business over time."
1,"They are improving sustainable engagement and organizational effectiveness, increasing share in all our markets including those where we already have significant leadership positions, growing revenues from new solutions as we become an ever more innovative business, and delivering sustainably higher margins through the cycle. I believe this sharpened focus together with the cultural change underway will allow us to build on our strengths creating the opportunity to achieve a significant step-up in performance over the medium term. Let me give you a little more detail starting with our people agenda."
1,"They are really energized by this, this year and the plan they have and we feel really good about kind of its value to Glu over the course of 2018. In terms of the Disney partnership, that really came about because of this new kind of style of rapid prototyping we do, which allows us to actually build something that's playable and then work with our partners, our potential partners. So we took an early prototype down to Disney, because we thought it was just the perfect IP for this type of game."
1,"They currently, whether co-incidentally or not, digital advertising is 8% of the volume of e-commerce. And if this relationship allows us to predict anything, our current digital advertising forecast would imply a 14% growth in e-commerce sales in 2018. Now since we did this forecast, we have specifically investigated e-commerce as we do once a year and in fact predict that it will rise 15% this year."
1,"They do not. In fact, they're   we think there is significant opportunity in both the attach, increasing the penetration of payments into their customer base, as well as the take rates."
1,"They were all done differently. And we have, I think, a significant opportunity to both improve the speed at which we get bills out and therefore get them collected and also the cost at which we do those billing processes. So I think that the answer is I think that there is opportunity."
1,"They were all done differently. And we have, I think, a significant opportunity to both improve the speed at which we get bills out and, therefore, get them collected and also the cost at which we do those billing processes. So, I think that the answer is I think that there is opportunity."
1,"They're high science projects, they're transformative in diseases that have large unmet need like sickle cell or alpha-1 antitrypsin disease or pain which we can talk about. We see a scientific opportunity to make a breakthrough drug, and if we're successful, we're going to be able to sell it through specialty markets with very low SG&A, which then allows us to re-funnel most of our OpEx into R&D. And that's sort of the unique part of our model I think compared to many other biotechs and of course, the trick is, how do you serially innovate?"
1,"They're our closest partners in terms of sourcing the material. But as I said, it's   we're kind of agnostic as long as we're retaining those rights and being able to monetize that, which will reduce the net cost of this investment in programming, which will allow us to continue to invest more in programming."
1,"They've been doing a nice job; sometimes we pick it up in the renewal process, sometimes we pick it up with new sales, and we continue to look at ways to communicate that opportunity to the customer and also incentivize the sales force to drive that. So, it remains a significant opportunity."
1,"They've partnered with us around our SmartView product and occupancy sensors. This will allow us to sell more cloud revenue, especially in the AsureSpace product line. So again, when I think back and reflect to 2017, I'm very, very proud of all the work we did, proud of the milestones we put up and that will bode well for the future of Asure."
1,"Third lever, a robust financial position and liquidity position. The anticipated cash generation in the period will allow us to honor our dividend commitments and strengthen our balance sheet by reducing debt levels. Fourth lever, an attractive and sustainable shareholder remuneration with a dividend growth of 5% up to 2020."
1,"Third, longer term, exiting our small ticket finance business and our secondary market mortgage business, which have been either unprofitable or only marginally profitable should slightly benefit our efficiency ratio. We believe these factors, among others, will allow us to achieve an improving efficiency ratio long term. Of course, our guidance regarding our improving efficiency ratio does not consider the potential impact of any future acquisitions."
1,"Third, we advanced efforts to digitize the proppant supply chain through the acquisition of Railtronix, which expands our offering upstream and combines it with our last mile supply chain tool called PropView. It allows us to deliver supply chain information to our customers from the mine all the way to the well site, including rail, transload trucking and well site inventory and consumption rates. Fourth, we launched the belly-dump unload kit that offers more trucking flexibility for our customers."
1,"Third, we will drive operating efficiencies and effectiveness through focused revenue growth and expense deployment. We have consistently demonstrated our ability to create positive operating leverage and we have significant opportunity to drive enhanced revenue growth, while redeploying expenses and capital. Fourth, we continue to invest in enterprise risk management professionals and systems to support the management of the enterprise."
1,"Thirdly, wherever possible, we will seek to fund the cash cost of any restructuring through reductions in working capital. The reviews today have highlighted significant opportunities to reduce inventory and close the gap between trade payables and trade receivables. We are committed to capitalizing on those opportunities."
1,"This accelerated transformation that we are discussing now will require $30 million to $80 million of incremental investment over the next two years to drive $50 million more annual savings by 2020 an attractive payback. We believe our actions across each of our segments will allow us to further strengthen our competitive position, accelerate our transformation and enhance our margins. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob, who'll walk through the financial performance and outlook in more detail."
1,"This acquisition reinforces our already strong position in the UK payout annuities and adds a great new retirement income solution, equity release mortgages to our product line up. Our capital strength allows us to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities. In addition to investments across our operating companies to drive organic growth, we continue to pursue M&A opportunities in the U."
1,"This agreement reflects our ongoing corporate evolution and signals the expansion of our mission to include environmental solutions focused on water. We believe that NanO2 offers a potentially impactful technology and the areas of water and wastewater treatment, and will allow us to help address the world's growing water challenges in a sustainable, responsible and cost effective manner. NanO2 solution utilizes proprietary nozzle technology that introduces super saturated oxygen solutions and other gas-water combinations to target process applications or environmental issues."
1,"This also allows us for leaner support structures because we're not supporting as many brands and therefore lowering future costs. And more importantly as well, will allow us to put better products to the market place across a smaller portfolio of brand. This plan will be implemented by the end of this financial year and then we'll allow it to grow our first half."
1,"This also drives our marketing communications and boutique experience. Second, we're putting in place disciplines that will allow us to consistently deliver against our core merchandising philosophies. Our planning and allocation teams have been working with the marketing team to create new processes that we believe will give us tangible benefits in 2018 and beyond."
1,"This brings the total number of Solaris outlets to more than 3,500. The strong expansion of this proven store-in-store concept allows us to combine leading sunglass fashion and technology with optical prescription and professional eye care expertise, and thereby, also capturing cross-selling opportunities. By the end of last year, almost half of our stores were complemented by the Solaris format."
1,"This condition supports our objectives to build and diversify our funding base. As we deploy more capital and apply modest leverage, our business will allow us to generate significant increase in earnings cash flows and our dividend. With that, we look forward to updating you with our release of Q1 in May, and we'll turn the call over to the operator for questions."
1,"This considerable change program will significantly increase our efficiency and deliver a more scalable platform. Key aspects include moving to our new London premises at a substantially lower cost, transforming our IT footprint and partnering with key service providers, and completing the implementation of our new single data architecture, which in turn will allow us to consolidate and streamline systems and processes. The majority of future savings will be achieved in 2019."
1,"This could be retail, residential, office or hotel, all which a very strong market demand. This allows us to pursue several opportunities for the redevelopment. The first option is an all retail renovation."
1,"This disciplined focus on efficiency, alignment and productivity will continue in our day-to-day management of the company. We're confident as we begin 2018 that the cost saving, restructuring and new investment decisions we have made will allow us to bring our successful and focused banking strategy to the entire Atlantic Capital footprint, while providing best-of-class service and solutions to our clients and prospects. Our banking teams are now almost fully staffed and are better aligned for meaningful improvement in performance."
1,"This does not take into effect the excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation which, depending on stock price and vesting schedule, could increase or decrease our tax rate and GAAP in a given quarter. In terms of our capital allocation priorities, we continue to focus first and foremost on investing in our business, as we see significant opportunity ahead. Our lower tax rate strengthens our ability to invest in both OpEx, such as adding engineering talent, as well as CapEx, such as investing in supercomputers for internal AI development."
1,"This dynamic is one of the driving factors behind the development of our Sense condition monitoring system, which significantly increases our customer intimacy. It allows us to understand how to bring more value to customers through the use of sophisticated analytics. The number of installations globally continues to increase."
1,"This enables us to retain the working capital facility of $50 million as well as the $100 million revolver that supports 2018 project financing. Our debt has reduced to $40 million at the end of 2017, and we have $150 million of unutilized facilities which allows us to support the business and pursue new work. Our borrowing costs are continuing to reduce as we have cancelled part of our facilities that have been unutilized."
1,"This enhanced rotor will allow for accurate thyroid testing up to 20 micrograms per deciliter, while our current test only provides results to 8 micrograms per deciliter. This improvement will expand our available market for the feline panel and will allow us to target many of our current customers not using that panel today.

1,"This is a hard business and we've learned a lot and had some failure too, which has certainly been very enabling in terms of what to do going forward and what to avoid based upon the past experience. But I think the oncology focus is one that allows us to again I'm certain, important foundational principles build value. And that's our goal and that's a hard goal to achieve, but it's one where we potentially have two franchise molecules in hand today with cabo and cobi."
1,"This is a high-performing program, and one, we, of course, know intimately. Today, we're also announcing a restructure to our balance sheet, which allows us to do all the things above, have a clean revolver, an adequate LC capacity, and it facilitates funding Ichthys in a way we can close this out while moving new KBR forward. Book-to-bill in Q4 was 1."
1,"This is a multi-year journey, but it's already starting to pay off. And so, really what that allows us to do, as I said earlier, is it really allows us to focus our core IP on building software solutions and not on big data centers. It provides the massive scalability and the other thing that's really important for public cloud is that it's providing access to a tremendous amount of innovation that's out in the industry."
1,"This is a new market for us. It allows us to access new areas in growth, taking our clinical expertise that we've built in specialty and bringing it to the PBM category. If you think about it, 80% of the costs in the United States are usually driven by 20% of the population, and that's true."

Second, we see significant opportunity in the design-oriented functional home furnishings market for our West Elm brand to capture more share. As one of the fastest growing, most profitable brands in the industry, it has continued to deliver accelerating growth domestically and globally, despite very low brand awareness."
1,This positions us well as we continue to invest in our dual growth strategy to capture more share with our core customer and to expand our business through our e-commerce strategy to win a younger consumer who exhibits different shopping characteristics. It also allows us to continue to make the necessary capital investments in our business to expand our vibrant retail footprint and strengthen our U. S.

But if we see differences in those product profiles, and again, in terms of rapidity of onset, the efficacy data across the two molecules, breastfeeding implications, et cetera, it gives us an opportunity to look at patient segmentation and utilize that in a way that allows us to segment the market that we can attach SAGE-217 to certain segments of the patient population and SAGE-547, so may not just be a moderate and severe play, as we get to the granularity of patient segmentation, it will really help us co-position these two molecules. I'll turn it to Jim, maybe talk about the insomnia."
1,"Ultra-high net worth clients   individuals globally are seeking connectivity, best-in-class advice, and access to unique products, all delivered by people and organization they trust. The new organization will allow us to fully exploit the benefits of a global model while maintaining our strong regional approach to serving clients and competing for talents. In terms of the timing, we wanted to ensure cross-border matters were largely addressed in Wealth Management and that restructuring and management changes in the U."
1,"Under the realignment, we consolidated our Printwear and branded apparel businesses into one marketing merchandising sales and distribution organization under the leadership of Mike Hoffman, previously president of Printwear. This consolidated structure will allow us to take advantage of the various dynamics affecting the marketplace. We're seeing retail brands making their way into Printwear, our products improvement We're seeing retail brands making their way into printwear, while products in print become more accessible to consumers through online vendors."
1,"Vehicle positioning was one of the areas that we wanted to enhance our skills at. We're going to continue to look at wireless communication, signal data management, data prioritization, anything in those areas that will allow us to enhance our connected car strategy as it relates to V2X autonomy. Any of those areas are technologies that we're actively pursuing right now in the market and looking at."
1,"Very importantly, both Gestra and Chromalox also operate through a direct sales model in their home countries. This allows us to extend the same successful growth formula of the group as applied internally to ourselves in the last decades. As you can see, both acquisitions broaden our platform for continued organic growth."
1,"Viafree also grows rapidly and we are now moving more and more money into developing those two products both in terms of tech and content. So, that is something that where we see opportunities to add even more investments to harvest even more growth. The penetration of SVOD services around the Nordics is actually still on fairly low levels."
1,"Voyager's strong performance in 2017 was evident across many functions of the business including clinical and preclinical development, manufacturing, operations, human resources and business development. This allows us to enter 2018 with an exciting program in Parkinson's disease that is about to enter a pivotal clinical trial, a group of pipeline programs targeting other severe neurological diseases that continue to advance towards the clinic and an exciting new collaboration with AbbVie to deliver monoclonal antibodies using AAV that allows us to pursue other important CNS disorders including Alzheimer's disease. For VY-AADC, we recently reported longer term follow-up data from the Phase 1b trial that, we believe, continues to demonstrate that VY-AADC can restore the brain's ability to make dopamine and offer patients better control over their motor function in response to levodopa therapy, the way they initially did during the earlier stages of their disease."
1,"We also are right in the middle now with implementing some new shipping optimization software, which we believe will also drive further efficiencies. And, listen, with the current trends we're experiencing with mall-based traffic within our own stores and positive comps in brick-and-mortar stores, that will allow us to continue to leverage brands. So, those are the three major things that will continue to drive those kind of results."
1,"We also continue to allocate resources to R&D to augment our product offering in particular this year we began the process of expanding product certification. We believe that the improved certification will allow us to service additional customers in more complex environment. This year, we were able to leverage our position as industry leaders, as we continue to outperform our peers in the oilfield services arena."
1,"We also ended September with $163 million in cash and no debt outstanding, so we're still in a great position to invest. We have positive cash flow and it really allows us to have maximum flexibility as we're still in the early stages of market conversion, so a strong balance sheet. Where are we going from here?"
1,"We also feel that we've proven our ability to grow in emerging markets with what we're now starting to see with Brazil, which is great. And we still see and we actually absolutely see a significant opportunity in this market particularly with the businesses we have in Argentina, Mexico and Chile to continue to grow those through the deployment of our IP and making further investment over the coming months and years. So that was all I wanted to cover today."
1,"We also have   it's liked by the market because instead of having one big train you've got a number of trains that, if something goes wrong, you still got some production, so that helps marketing. It definitely makes it simpler from molecules in sharing or non-sharing of molecules, but it also allows us to optimize the scope of sharing of infrastructure at the plant site, and that's where the focus will be on in the next couple of months, on working a commercial agreement which allows us to share that in an appropriate commercial way. I should say, and I think Patrick PouyannÃ© was saying last week, that there were strong alignment and good commonality between the various key players, and I think you said the fight was behind us."
1,We also have a very strong beer innovation pipeline now and for the future with ample opportunities to increase distribution and space across our portfolio. Corona Refresca is one of these opportunities and based on our consumer research is more than 80% incremental to our growth
1,"We also have I think certain opportunities to repurchase some of our real estate, and in an effort to repurchase our real estate we will lower our overall cost of capital and eliminate or at least reduce the burden of lease escalators in future years. We also have significant opportunities to optimize the portfolio. As I take you back quickly to the map it might be a little hard to see, but you can see especially in the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeastern states we have   we have significant number of properties in those states where we have true market density."
1,"We also have secured cGMP manufacturing of our lead compound, and are well under way to get a first clinical batch ready over the next few months. This batch and the preclinical study results mentioned earlier will allow us to finalize the cell manufacturing protocol. In other words, we have established a clear path and started to make good progress on the clinical development of RXI-762."
1,"We also have several product enhancements in the pipeline to further enhance the effectiveness of our ultrafiltration therapy. Looking ahead, we continue to fine-tune growth strategies to optimize a significant opportunity to impact both improved clinical outcomes and healthcare cost reductions by giving healthcare providers an option to diuretics. We're developing and refining our strategic focus to demonstrate a strong business model by driving revenue."
1,"We also have spoken about that previously, started on our digital journey a while ago, and we've started to also invest in that space. And we have   precisely to not disrupt operational activities in our different countries and operating companies, we have re-roadmapped the global ERP rollout to take into account the new digital requirement because we believe that these digital capabilities will allow us to grow much faster and to serve our customers much better. So we are in the midst of re-roadmapping the global ERP rollout against that new and very important requirement once again because we are quite keen not to disrupt business performance and distract operating teams on the ground, let's say, with too much hassle or distraction that is not devoted to growing our business."
1,"We also have the right strategy with our highly productive agency, driving high-quality earnings streams, and our significant track record of growth since IPO. This sets AIA apart in the market, enabling us to access the significant opportunities for growth for many years to come. Thank you for listening."
1,"We also look for opportunities to expand our products set in important ways that build into our solution, probably the best example on a standalone basis about is SpiderCloud, which we acquired last summer. It allows us to take our iDAS, indoor distributed antenna system solution that was really great and gaining a lot of traction in buildings over 200,000 square feet to smaller buildings kind of a hotel sized building because we can then go to small cells and early results have been pretty good. Customers have reacted very positively, and we're excited about the potential, AFOP brought its own products that help us with our solutions in the data center space and also some access to different parts of big data center customers and to some Asian customers."
1,"We also manage our horsepower differently. One of the things we do is we charter in about 25% of our horsepower and that allows us to variablize that cost. So, if barge utilization declines, we can still keep our horsepower utilization high by laying off some charter boats."
1,"We also performed these assays on our product in a characterization mode, but we decided to take the FDA suggestion and incorporate these assays as quality control release assays to provide greater assurance of product quality control in our manufacturing process. The added time that we're taking now allows us to tailor these platform methods to our product, validate these assays and incorporate the data into the BLA. So that was the first of the two reasons that Michael spoke of."
1,"We also plan to examine the performance of diverters alongside downhole fiber optics to monitor the effectiveness of subsurface stimulation. In addition, fiber optics will allow us to closely study the impact of high intensity stimulation across the clusters in a stage. As part of these efforts, we've recently announced that WildHorse was selected for a Department of Energy study alongside Texas A&M University and researchers from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Stanford University to develop a new field laboratory in the Eagle Ford formation."
1,"We also provided you with our targets for 2018, announcing at the same time that we have implemented an organizational consolidation of our sales, marketing and distribution activities. This will allow us to better leverage our go-to-market capabilities, and drive operational efficiencies across the front end of our business. We'll cover this later, but first let me take you through some details on our fourth quarter results."
1,"We also see potential for additional high value partnerships that we cannot comment more on that what we have already done and then we continue to explore new products and new concepts with our validated peptide platform and technology. So this is how we are moving forward continuing with the lean and agile organization and an effective business model that allows us to make fast progress on our pipeline as we have done in the past years towards the market. So with that, moving to page 29, I will hand back to the operator to lead the Q&A session."
1,"We anticipate announcing new leadership for the JetBlue Travel Products group in the near term. We believe this structure will allow us to invest in a focused and disciplined manner, to grow a capital-light, high-margin ancillary revenue stream. We also expect to introduce a new booking flow on our website, in order to better merchandise the Travel Products, as the share of leisure customers booking through jetblue."
1,"We anticipate submitting the effectiveness and safety technical sections in the first half of this year and the CMC section by the end of this year. This drug will allow us to realize the full fever therapy opportunity and we're excited to bring to veterinarians this owner-friendly, easy to administer fever-reducing agent for horses. Regarding updates on the rest of our equine portfolio, we reported positive pivotal results from our pilot field effectiveness study in 2017 for KIND-011, our anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, which targets sick or septic foals."
1,"We anticipate the momentum on a strong finish in 2017 will continue into 2018. We believe the continued ramp of our military business, the growing adoption of AR systems for both industry and enterprise and the demand for SOLOS along with other new product rolls out, will allow us to increase revenue in 2018 by 25% to 40% to a range of about $35 million to $40 million. In addition, we are anticipating increasing demand for our products and components which allows us to achieve breakeven probability by year-end 2019."
1,"We anticipate using a portion of the corporate tax reform benefits for incremental investment spending; as I referenced earlier, in the areas of technology modernization efforts, consumer facing digital technologies and product development capabilities. Finally, we will continue to incur some costs in our Individual ACA-compliant market, which allows us to be positioned to reenter certain markets in 2019, if appropriate. Below the line, we expect investment income of approximately $825 million and interest expense of approximately $775 million."
1,"We anticipate we will continue to see improvement in non-ticket as the initiatives launched in 2017 continues pulling to maturity. In addition, later this year, we plan to roll out some enhancements that will allow us to further leverage technology to improve our ability to both price and merchandise our non-ticket products which should put us on a path to again deliver higher ancillary revenue per passenger segment for the full year 2018. With that, here's Ted to discuss our cost performance and first quarter outlook."
1,"We are a margin business and as such, we continue to take action to drive our operating expenses lower through a combination of continued efficiencies and cost reductions as well as a streamlining initiative such as the AWP Olmos divestiture set to close today. This divestiture further streamlines our portfolio and allows us to better leverage our existing personnel, while lowering our per-unit lifting cost. You'll see from our guidance, we are targeting lease operating expenses plus transportation and processing for 2018 of roughly $0."
1,"We are actively discussing that with them. We also, as we've talked about in the past, have, in addition to those three assets which are towers, small cells and fiber, we have the land under our towers which allows us to potentially attract other investments and things like edge data centers that we again think we are uniquely positioned to attract. And as we do so, all of those can have different customer bases than we have had historically."
1,"We are also continuing to find new sales opportunities for new and existing components for the over 9 million RVs on the road today. Our teams have done an amazing job of establishing a call center and channels for all the key partners in the space, which really allows us to turbocharge programs like furniture, mattresses, jacks, steps and awnings. We are just scratching the surface of this opportunity and expect continued great success on the top and bottom lines in our aftermarket businesses."
1,"We are also excited to welcome WoodSpring developers to the Choice family. We expect our new relationships with these developers to benefit our lineup of new construction-focused brands, and will allow us to expand WoodSpring's footprint. Furthermore, as industry fundamentals remain favorable, we expect continued supply growth and robust 2018 franchise sales activity."
1,"We are also preparing to launch our private equity business in Shenzhen to capture demand for private equity investments in Mainland China. Our Shenzhen subsidiary has already obtained the Qualified Foreign Limited Partnership license, which allows us to raise funds offshore and onshore to invest in domestic private equity projects, subject to regulations. Furthermore, our Classic Fund is awaiting approval for the Mutual Recognition of Funds Program."
1,"We are asset sensitive as many of you know and have a very valuable deposit franchise. Over the last several years, it's been real difficult to stay invested on the short end of curve, but going forward, I believe we will benefit from that decision and it will allow us to pass on some loan opportunities that we are uncomfortable with either because of pricing and/or the structure. I feel very fortunate to be in this situation today."
1,"We are carefully assembling this team to include a strong mix of experienced and proven leaders along with new roles for top emerging talent promoted from within our organization who know our company and customers well. This mix of knowledge, experience and fresh ideas will be important because, together with our field and store teams, we will be laser focused on assessing the needs of our customers to build a strategy that allows us to compete and win in our core markets. Our talented and dedicated Rite Aid team gives us the momentum we need to tackle this important opportunity."
1,"We are connecting that engine to two different platforms via technology links. One, a world-class scheduling platform and the second is the Phreesia platform and what that connection allows us to do is create a solution that automates the interface between the scheduling and the registration process and allows us to enable customers in multi-modes to self-register, but have access to all of the detailed logic that has historically sit outside of Phreesia but in our core rules engine, and we're doing this in the acute care setting which adds a layer of complexity that is not normally seen in the outpatient setting. So that is the overall architecture that's encapsulated."
1,"We are continuing the geographic expansion in this region and the work has proceeded during the quarter. We are now putting our own sales teams and infrastructure on the ground in Japan, China, and Latin America, and we're also working very hard on making our current products available in more markets through investments into a registration process that will allow us to cut the tail of pending and delayed registration processes to the minimum by the end of 2018. So moving to slide 9 and let me go a little bit more into detail regarding the profitability development."
1,"We are continuously looking for additional cost savings and revenue-generating opportunities. As I said in the press release this morning, we feel confident about our financial flexibility heading into 2018. We delivered better-than-expected performance to end the fourth quarter and this is carried over into 2018 with positive season pass and attendance trends."
1,"We are currently evaluating a variety of new opportunities, what we believe we can leverage our IP expertise, to collaborate and partner with high-growth companies with potentially structured technology. We expect future deal sizes to be at the level that will allow us to diversify our partnerships across a number of different opportunities in a variety of technology sectors. We anticipate sharing more details about future partnerships as and when we make strategic decisions to proceed with any potential opportunities."
1,"We are designing models that allow us to the same morals that allow us to see what the optimum balance between corporate and for franchise. Obviously in order to make better make better use of our capital, and better use of our capital as Roberto mentioned it will allows us to look into the initiative of acquisition opportunities to come into new segments and new countries. So, that's, that's actually an important topic and capability develop."
1,"We are doing this over a time phased approach and targeting those areas where we can have the most impact. The new cloud-based system is the foundation that allows us to connect all of our administrative, engineering and production systems. We expect to reduce manual intervention and overhead, as well as improved material management, uptime and problem resolution."
1,"We are engaged in those hypersonic missile pursuits and as a prime across the board. So we do believe that hypersonics is the next wave of technology relative to advanced missile systems, and that there are significant opportunities out there and we've positioned ourselves here over multiple years to be ready to go capture those opportunities. And we feel very, very positive about that."
1,"We are entering 2018 with a simpler, more sustainable portfolio in South Africa consisting of the long-life, world-class Mponeng Mine in the West Wits region along with our surface operations comprised of the long-life Mine Waste Solutions tailings with treatment operations and the surface rock dump reclamation operations. Accounting for roughly just under 15% of our group production on a pro forma basis and our streamlined business in South Africa will allow us to shift our focus and energy away from managing marginal ounces to a tidier portfolio with increased operating stability, intensified safety efforts and margin growth opportunities as Mponeng Below 120 project ramps up. Phase 2 currently under evaluation would deepen the secondary shaft to further extend its life."
1,"We are excited for these upcoming clinical milestones. We believe that our current financial resources will allow us to deliver efficacy readouts in each of these ongoing and planned trials with AXS-05 and AXS-07. Now, for more detail regarding our ongoing clinical programs, I will turn the call over to Cedric for a review."
1,"We are excited that the Phase 2 study is now open for enrollment, Vical conducted a rigorous process to select high quality sites that has the greatest potential for recruitment, based on the recruitment rates from prior trials and their expertise in conducting invasive aspergillosis studies. We believe this site selection effort will allow us to maximize recruitment in a cost effective manner and we estimate that the trial could take approximately 24 months to fully enroll at roughly 40 major cancer and transplant centers in North America, Europe and Asia. In parallel with the Phase 2, Vical is conducting additional non-clinical work with external experts to better understand the mechanism of action of VL-2397 against aspergillosis and its activity against other invasive fungal pathogens."
1,"We are following a disciplined approach ensuring that first we continue to drive cash flow performance, which provides the resources to invest in the business to drive profitable growth. We're focused on maintaining a sound and strong capital structure, ensuring capital market access which will allow us to pursue acquisitions and alliances that continue to bolster our core competencies and capabilities, and finally provide a return to our shareholders. We believe the actions and initiatives we've taken over the last several years which has certainly driven our strong financial performance only affirms our focus on these fundamental priorities as outlined in the coming slide."
1,"We are going to take advantage of the growth opportunities we have whether it's in the truck franchise, in the adjacencies, in our international business as we continue to execute towards our path to 10% margins in the core business. We also have a significant opportunity to further enhance our overall business with personal mobility, which will be accretive to our strong core business. Taken together, the strong core business coupled with the potential of the future mobility businesses really represents a significant upside opportunity from a valuation standpoint, and we are absolutely focused on continuing our journey to capitalize on all of these opportunities going forward."
1,"We are happy with the results and new developments of the three alliances that we will continue reinforcing in 2018. The joint venture with CaixaBank we presented a few minutes ago will allow us to keep increasing our offering and sets the path for future partnerships. In page 38, you can see some of the projects we are developing through Nexus by DIA."
1,"We are in the process of moving forward with some of this capacity expansion, which will increase our production capability beyond what it currently is. In the fourth quarter, we finished the build out of our startup remote distribution facilities in Sparks, Nevada that will allow us to provide shorter delivery times to customers in the Western U. S."
1,"We are internally developing a new diagnosis and reporting tool which represent an evolution of current Stars that we expect to be very welcomed by our clients. The fee on top for Star Plus will range from 20 basis points up to 100 basis points with differentiated pricing for asset under management, asset under custody and ETF, and this will allow us to make asset under custody more profitable. In addition, through the diagnosis to clients, we expect to speed up in the transformation process into asset under management."
1,"We are investing in growth, we're investing in product modularization, so we can get product to market more quickly and that we can be simpler in terms of how we face off externally to our clients and brokers and customers and more agile. In terms of the overall market space, I'll start with where I think where we have a significant opportunity is the Medicare space. We have been historically under penetrated in the Medicare Advantage Individual market."
1,"We are launching an initiative focused on cross-selling our services to top international law firms. By better harnessing the power of our existing networks, we can drive growth both geographically and in practices where significant opportunities exist. As we went through our planning process this year, it was clear that we have long-term growth opportunities across all of our practice areas and industries."
1,We are leveraging the concrete accessories business that we've developed here in the United States across our Canadian platform. There is still significant opportunity to be able to grow there from just their historical fastener business. So that's the reason why Canada has been getting more involved in larger projects.
1,"We are looking into opportunities to decentralize certain aspects of our manufacturing activities to lower our cost. Additionally, we are pursuing inventory strategies that will allow us to improve our delivery capabilities and respond faster to our clients. We will use these benefits to help accelerate the energy market penetration for our chemistry offerings during 2018."
1,"We are moving forward on critical qualifications at our Athens facility that when completes, will provide vital capacity and a lead time advantage to a tightening aerospace market and a recovering energy market. We are investing in key growth areas and the recent tax reform allows us to accelerate those investments. These investments will strengthen our current workforce and add new jobs in the future."
1,"We are particularly excited about this acquisition due to its location adjacent to our existing operations in the sweet spot of this highly productive play. Our understanding of the rock, extensive experience in the area, and access to existing infrastructure will allow us to maximize the value of this core area. You can expect us to drill at least five wells on this acreage in 2018."
1,"We are reducing the work that it takes to take, for a pharmacy to run by moving the mundane operational activities and automating them. This allows us to automate them in a more prÃ©cised manner, allows the cloud to do more analysis to make sure there are no large mistakes made when it comes to safety, drug ordering, or even understanding what the clinical impacts on certain drug usages are. For example, in a hospital, the hospital is responsible for the drug cost."
1,"We are retaining the existing clients, attracting new business and bringing in talented professionals for our teams. There continues to be significant opportunity to drive operating leverage, as we bring our operating model that enables us to continue to grow revenues at 2 to 3 times the level of expenses. As we previously presented, the transaction has enabled us to present positive EPS accretion immediately along with significantly growing tangible book value per share."
1,"We are scheduled to go live in June of this year. And this is a really important project for us, because it helps us to reduce cost, but it also allows us to provide some pretty unique offerings, particularly to the C&I segment that other people can't compete with. And as part of this balancing authority, we are installing a battery, it's a 10 megawatt battery and it'll enhance the reliability of our operation."
1,"We are taking a number of steps to build a stronger Genmab for the future. In 2017, we doubled our proprietary clinical pipeline and we are continuing to make investments in a preclinical pipeline that will allow us to build a highly innovative product pipeline of the future. Specifically, our target is to file four new investigational New Drug Applications over the next four years."
1,"We are targeting the second half of 2018 for the publication of these results. So, to summarize the status of the therapy business, we believe our focus on capital customers will allows us to maximize a long-term profitable market opportunity in the skin brachytherapy area. In addition, we continue to achieve progress in the U."
1,"We are trying to be conservative, but the real change in the approach to the guidance is that, we have a lot of dynamic and unique opportunities ahead of us. We want to prioritize those and be reasonable in what we can actually accomplish for the year with a focus that allows us to truly execute against those. So we just want to set the expectations that we can accomplish that."
1,"We are uniquely positioned among REITs to benefit from these defense-related growth opportunities. Having solidified our competitive advantage in our government franchise and expanded that expertise into developing data center shells allows us to generate predictable incremental cash flows and value creation. We cast a much wider, much stronger net than ever before and are in a position of strength to capitalize on the growth opportunities present and emerging in our markets."
1,"We are uniquely positioned with our complete vehicle competence in engineering, integration and, manufacturing. Our expertise with alternative propulsion systems and our capabilities to support ADAS and autonomy provide significant opportunities for Magna Steyr and Magna. And we aim to be the ideal partner for new mobility solutions."
1,"We are very clear on what we need to be done to return Altice France to growth with a new management team tasked to fully implement the Altice Model. Core to this strategy is reducing churn, which will allow us to grow our customer base, as we do not have any issue to the volume of sales we have in France. Instead of broadband price increases, which aggravated churn previously, we are now monetizing content by upselling premium subscribers with new bundle structures that we have introduced."
1,"We are very confident in our 2021 targets of $1 billion in revenue, 70% gross margin, and above-market profitability. The future beyond 2021 is rich with significant opportunities for growth through our innovation pipeline and further geographic expansion. We are focusing on delivering innovation to our customers' worldwide and superior returns for our shareholders."
1,"We are very excited about what we've accomplished with BELBUCA to-date, and look forward to future success through 2018. In order to maximize the significant opportunity we have with BELBUCA, we recently increased our number of territory managers from 65 to 85. Overall, this adds over 3,500 new high-prescribing healthcare practitioner targets and multiple new geographies not previously covered by our sales force."
1,We are working with CMS to have EXPAREL unbundled within that draft rule. Securing separate reimbursement for EXPAREL would create a significant opportunity for us. Commercial payers already recognize the economic advantage of reimbursing EXPAREL separately under C9290.
1,"We believe continued focus within growing industry verticals should allow us to expand the breadth of our service offerings to deepen our relationships with these larger sophisticated buyers. This strategy is well-supported by our mature centralized delivery platform, which allows us to deliver consultants at scale across the United States. This capability combined with improved execution and focus in our field offices has also allowed us to increase productivity levels again this quarter."
1,"We believe our new structure positions us to better leverage a common platform across all of our brands and distribution channels. While we are making investments in areas that will enhance our capabilities including distribution and e-commerce initiatives, a more streamlined and linear front-end organization will allow us to better capitalize on the market opportunities for our brands and drive operational efficiencies and cost savings across the organization. In light of this new organizational structure, we expect to report under one reportable business segment going forward to reflect how we are running the business in a consolidated and optimized manner."
1,"We believe that puts us in a great position relative to what our expectations are for 2018. So the way you should think about that sales and marketing then in 2018 is we'll continue to add here or there, as we see opportunities to do so, but we're exiting in a really good sort of sales force optimization point. So we don't need to be adding as many as we've had to add in prior years."
1,"We believe that this positive trend validates our platform approach to data security and supports our investments in R&D to expand and extend the solution we offer our customers. It also further reinforces the significant opportunity we still have to sell into our existing customer base. One upcoming change in regards to our product families, when we first introduced DatAlert, we thought of it as an add-on to DatAdvantage."
1,"We believe that we have a balanced, long-term approach to capital allocation which benefits both our customers and our shareholders. Our priorities for capital remain focused on pursuing targeted and on strategy acquisitions to drive scale, customer expansion and new capabilities; returning capital to our shareholders through share buybacks, including the completion of our current NCIB to purchase up to 10% of our public float; and finally, investing in cost management programs across our global network, which will allow us to further accelerate productivity initiatives to reduce costs for Celestica and our customers. In summary, we are executing on the strategy we put in place two years ago despite volatility in our CCS business and are looking to enhance our performance in 2018."
1,"We believe that we will be able to return to meaningful growth in 2019 by; one, revamping our Nutrisystem ads; two, further monetizing the customer journey with a focus on both weight loss and weight management; three, continuing to grow the South Beach Diet brand; and four, having a multi-year product pipeline including a new program for Nutrisystem that we are looking forward to launching next diet season. And importantly our multi-brand platform also allows us to add more brands so the right opportunities and timing present themselves. I'll now turn the call over to Mike who will walk through our 2017 fourth quarter and full-year financial results and discuss our 2018 guidance as well as our plans to increase our dividend."
1,"We believe that we're creating something that doesn't exist in this industry, and it's affording us an ability to become an even stronger player. Yes, it makes us bigger, but we're less interested in being bigger, as opposed to better, and this certainly is providing a portfolio that allows us to be better as a company which affords us an ability to provide services to our customers. You can look at the makeup of the business, you can see the backlog and the sales, and what not."
1,"We believe that with the consolidation of the semiconductor industry as well as in other industries such as laser micro processing, OEMs are looking for strong suppliers that can weather long-term ups and downs in the industry, looking for long-term suppliers that can invest in CapEx and build factories and manage their supply chain so that they don't have to. And so we believe firmly that size doesn't matter; a broad portfolio allows us to provide unique solutions rather than a single segment type of a company. And then what happened when we acquired Newport is that we went from, as I mentioned before, 70% to 75% semi to about 50% to 60% semi."
1,"We believe that's a winning strategy. We believe that it allows us to go back to our priority of joint value creation, and we believe it's something that we need to keep raising the bar on because it is a very, very dynamic shopping channel. And finally, just to touch on what I mentioned earlier, you will see a lot more coolers in the market in Western Europe with a lot more different branding."
1,"We believe that's how we're going to drive value to our shareholders. We have significant backlog, and therefore significant opportunity to continue to grow. I'll separate that from a quarter-to-quarter dynamic, where we pointed out we have a significant upsurge in growth in Q2, which positioned us well not just for this year, but for   into next year."
1,"We believe the business will be even stronger with Blackstone as a partner. We also believe that the transaction will provide value to Thomson Reuters' shareholders, and our ownership interest in the business will allow us to participate in the future upside of that business. That's why we are retaining a 45% ownership interest."
1,"We believe the surgical management of pain may provide an effective, non-pharmacologic resolution for many causes of recurrent and chronic pain. The pain universe is large, and the potential to apply surgical nerve repair and nerve management techniques to address issues such as neuropathy, migraine headache, pain associated with hernia repair, or nerve injuries resulting from total joint replacement creates a significant opportunity for us to introduce new products and expanded applications for our product portfolio. In November, AxoGen announced FDA clearance for AxoGuard Nerve Cap."
1,"We believe this collaboration provides Nektar with the best strategic path forward to maximize the potential of NKTR-214 while retaining control of this important and valuable asset. And most importantly, it allows us to rapidly establish NKTR-214 as the backbone immuno-oncology therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other cancer treatments. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes walking through the details of the economic terms."
1,We believe this is resulting in a valuation disconnect in the marketplace about the true value of this joint venture interest. Consolidating the entire Fuji Xerox with Xerox will allow us to create a much simpler and clearer financial profile and realize the full value of this joint venture interest. Investors will be able to see our global financial results on a consolidated basis and value it appropriately.
1,"We believe we and Sanofi will be able to target the entire adult type 1 population, because we did study the broadest patient population in our studies and we have the most comprehensive efficacy and safety data. Given the size of the market and the fact that sotagliflozin has the potential to address the entire market, you can see that this is a significant opportunity for Sanofi and for Lexicon. Now, I'll turn it back to you, Pablo."
1,We believe we have created a whole ecosystem around how some of the customers which are signing up for these policies can be upsold new insurance policies going forward in the future. So we believe we have a strong competitive positioning which will allow us to continue to deliver on this kind of protection numbers going forward in the future also.
1,"We came into the year with an effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis of roughly 31%. We're now guiding to 23%, so a significant opportunity for us. We've taken the opportunity to reinvest roughly half of that savings back into the business, and it would be in areas such as R&D and marketing."
1,"We can use this technology for midstream companies for pipelines, for utilities, drilling to lay utilities similar to a pipeline. We see significant opportunity in the U. S."
1,"We certainly work to add those new clients. And we also have a   within that, we have a very significant opportunity in the cross-selling opportunities. So, when we formed Cotiviti through a merger a few years ago, a primary part of that thesis was if we took the leader in pre-payment and the leader in post-payment and you put them together, could you create a market momentum synergy in cross-selling, and our results today indicate that that was a wise choice and it's really working well."
1,"We completed the construction of a new larger facility in Shanghai to accommodate our growth in China. In Singapore, we opened a new regional headquarters and technical innovation center, which allows us to further focus on customer intimacy and make our company's technology fully available to our customers in this region. We also began construction in Thailand on a new regional manufacturing facility to expand both production capacity and capability to support both segments' growth in Southeast Asia."
1,"We continue investing to enhance our customer experience by focusing on our service; optimizing marketing strategies; improving visual merchandising, both in store and online; plus providing free design consultation; and further integrating our connected customer experience. As we continue to increase the awareness of Floor & Decor brand, we believe there is significant opportunity to gain market share. Our studies indicated we can get a customer to experience the Floor & Decor brand in-store or online prior to making a purchase decision."
1,"We continue to adopt a conservative stance with respect to managing our underwriting risk appetite, investment portfolio, reserving process fees, reinsurance buying, and catastrophe risk management. This allows us to maintain higher operating leverage in the industry as a whole with each combined ratio point now equating to 110 basis points of operating ROE post tax reform. This model positions us well to generate superior returns in today's low interest rate environment."
1,"We continue to believe that there's opportunity there. We see opportunities in terms of our store operating expenses, including store supplies. We also see opportunities in other spaces such as our insurance coverage, some of our DC operation efficiencies and the like."
1,"We continue to benefit from our unique currency mix with 48% of our portfolio denominated in dollar given our strict currency policy between our assets and liabilities. As mentioned on the previous slide, our investment's flexibility remains high which will allow us to save more rapidly higher reinvestment rates and therefore will improve the recurring yield of the portfolio. Our duration gap is not yet closed which commits us to continue reinvesting at longer maturities."
1,"We continue to drive robust, near-term growth throughout our business while executing on our strategic imperatives to strengthen our foundation for long-term, profitable growth. We are excited about our significant opportunities in 2018 and even more so for 2019 and beyond. We have created tremendous value for Insulet's shareholders and improved the lives of more than 140,000 people living with diabetes."
1,"We continue to focus on reducing the burn, which we think we've been keeping an eye on over the last number of quarters and we have plans that allow us to have that cash lasting into 2019. If we elect to raise capital, the good news is we don't think we really need a lot given that profile and we feel confident there's a number of opportunities open to us, including debt and equity."
1,"We continue to have productive discussions with officials from Sonangol in anticipation of reaching a fair and equitable agreement that allows VAALCO to exit Block V at a reasonable cost. We would like to settle this issue quickly which will allow us to remove the $15 million liability from our balance sheet. With our realized pricing correlated to Brent, no hedges in place for 2018 and a forecasted free cash flow breakeven price in 2018 of approximately $40 per barrel of oil sales, we are well positioned to add to our cash position."
1,"We continue to look at very hard at acquisitions for M&A. Again, a key point on the M&A, as we look at opportunities and in the interior/exterior, it also allows the opportunity for us to move into different regions that we may not have, but certainly also allows us to obtain products and product approvals for customers that are on our developing and opportunity list. So, content and acquisition around that, very, very important."
1,"We continue to preserve significant dry powder to meet future potential opportunities in a changing credit and pricing environment. Our existing available year-end liquidity allows us to grow our current assets under management by 20% without any new external financing. And finally, on March 16, 2017, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann & Company to which Saratoga may offer for sale from time to time up to $30 million of its common stock, do an at-the-market or ATM offering."
1,"We continue to pursue a number of investment opportunities with attractive returns relative to their underlying risk profiles, which will enhance the overall yield of the portfolio. Longer term, we anticipate market dynamics to become more balanced and provide meaningfully more attractive investment opportunities, which will allow us to deploy a significant amount of cash we are generating from monetizing non-core investments. Lastly, I'd like to discuss our long-term portfolio objectives."
1,"We continue to remain highly disciplined on the expense front as we identify opportunities to redeploy expense dollars out of lower value areas in order to continue to self-fund our growth initiative and enhance capabilities to serve customers. Continuous improvement is part of our DNA and we continue to become more efficient, which allows us to fund our growth initiatives and maintain strong operating leverage. With that, let's move on and discuss the balance sheet."
1,"We continue to see   and I apologize, this is Dominic again. We continue to see consolidation within the industries and the clients that we serve grow in market share and as such in the bailment business we see opportunity to continue to grow that key portion of the business. In addition, we see the opportunity to sell other services including a full product of logistic services which is repackaged armored car services, insurance, reconciliation, and cash optimization fee services."
1,"We continued to improve our global safety performance, strengthened our capital structure with a high-yield offering, increased cash and liquidity through our relentless focus on cash management, and invested a significant amount of new resources in several operational, commercial and internal areas. Additionally, we developed our strategic growth plan with a regional operating model, which will allow us to deliver customer solutions at a local level. We also took steps to focus on our core business and enhanced returns by making changes to our product portfolio by substantially completing the exit from our remaining non-core Belleli EPC product sales business in the Middle East and moving certain production-related products to assets held for sale classification as we seek to exit product families, which do not fit our longer-term strategic direction."
1,"We decided that we're going to align ourselves with high-end foundries on process technology and so we're fairly aggressive in the usage of 16-nanometer and 14-nanometer and certainly with 7-nanometer. And as a result, it allows us to really focus on the architecture and we believe that there's substantial innovation on the architecture on the base CPUs as well as on the system elements of the architecture and that is what we did with Zen. I think Zen was very, very successful in terms of a step function improvement in a performance."
1,"We deliver great customer service for our highest valued customers. And ultimately, if that channel allows us to build knowledge and capability in this space, and is actually greater economic through this channel as well for us. But the third-party install channel is using existing installers in the market to effectively allow us to get into new markets quickly to scale up and scale down our sales scale up and scale down, you can our inflation at the same pace."
1,"We did 38% in 2017 but you also don't want to put a guidance out there that will stop you from taking business opportunities that you might see. So where we put a guidance out, we try to come up with an amount that will allow us to take advantage of opportunities and not be overly cautious about cost, and we think a good place to be is 40% in terms of the guidance."
1,"We did take a deliberate decision several years ago to diversify into our six focus cities. Obviously, we are focused on a couple right now, but that was really kind of plant the flag, knowing that then we should get several years of accretive revenue growth as we kind of moved up that S-curve and that's why   again, we are not looking for any other focus city at the moment, because we see opportunity to grow."
1,"We distribute our products within both Florida and our 15 other active states, through a robust network of independent agent partners, as well as our unique direct-to-consumer platform, Universal Direct. Our vertically integrated structure allows us to provide superior customer service, reduced cost for both ourselves and our reinsurance partners and remained extremely nimble. Our first-class claims operation is focused on timely claims settling and providing outstanding service to our policy holders."
1,We do and price it and   let's put it this way. We do want to take advantage of our balance sheet and times with buying inventory that will allow us to use price and basically take advantage of opportunity. We've done that.
1,"We do anticipate there being less activity and less growth in CRE compared to the last few years but we're happy that we'll have more diversified balance sheet. The changes we made in the fourth quarter by adding on a Chief Lending Officer, allows us to really concentrate on an area that we hadn't been for the past several years and that's the C&I world, so between C&I and Signature Financial, we'll be able to make up any shortfall that we would have in the CRE market."
1,"We do approximately $14 million per ship set worth of content on the Boeing 767. So what this contract extension does is it allows us to build not only the Tanker variant, but follow-on for Commercial, which was otherwise going to come to an end and potentially could be competed. So, it extends the program now for a full 10 years."
1,"We do believe, however, that there are other factors driving our guidance with respect to volume and that is capital spending, yes, our investment in outpatient facilities and physician strategies also and numerous other initiatives that have been sort of our core approach to the market all along. And we think those elements will allow us to recover market share gains again and ultimately compete I think in a marketplace that we believe is starting to recover slightly from where it was over the past 18 months. And that's sort of our thinking."
1,"We do build spec homes in our communities and we believe that helps us compete against the existing home market. It allows us to capture buyers who need to move into a home a bit more quickly, perhaps are coming out of an apartment and their leases coming up. And so that gives us a chance to put them into homes more quickly, allows us to compete very well, but it also allows us a lot of efficiencies in how we manage our inventory, manage our production community-by-community."
1,"We do have   we constantly look at our cash flow and we have upside from leasing and from rental rate increases that we expect to increase cash flow. Be assured, we, as a management team and board, always look at the key drivers of the business and evaluate those, and we feel confident in the ability of our   our ability to increase cash flow over the coming years."
1,"We do have now flexibility to scale our staffing up or down, we're not tied to fixed FTE levels as we were in the past. We have the introduction of a flexible work force which allows us to control unit costs and variable costs in the call center. But in addition, it gives us a platform for scalability."
1,"We do have the Safran contract in France which is turned on in the fourth quarter, and that's going to be a source of positive growth for us throughout the year. As Dennis alluded, the Products backlog is very healthy and we see opportunities there as well. For Services the spring will be strong, we have no reason to expect that the fall won't be good."
1,"We do not   in Europe things are flat. We are not seeing any significant opportunity. Then come to this part of the world, Latin America continues to be an issue, a significant issue, a problem."
1,"We do see an opportunity with an $80 billion pipeline to compete in the specialized services marketplace. Again, our CareMore assets a really interesting opportunity for us there, because it allows us to take some of the most acute and ill population and really manage their care to deliver extraordinary results, both in cost-of-care, but also in outcomes for those patients. So that's an opportunity."
1,"We don't have any debt maturities until 2021. And as we look at our organic development opportunities, what that financial flexibility does is allows us to ensure that we're going to be able to deliver on those projects. So, the projects that we have in the pipeline right now is Tasiast Phase One and Two, and we're going to talk a little bit more about what those phases are."
1,"We don't need to get the overhead allocation or recovery on lower-margin Commercial wine to prop up that part of the business. We'd rather rip out those costs, walk away from that lower-margin Commercial wine and, as a result of that, allows us to accelerate the premiumisation of the business. It allows our sales organization to focus on more selling, more Luxury and Masstige products and also some higher-margin Commercial."
1,"We don't view that as an end-all; we view that as an example of the things that we ought to be doing to help small businesses get in front of their customers, given local is such a big use case for all of us around Twitter, helping local businesses get in front of their customers on Twitter is a big opportunity for us. So we see opportunity in all the areas that you described and there's a lot of work for us to do in each of them."
1,"We emerged from 2017 with pride in our accomplishments and with our strategic approach refined and improved by both successes and failures. Looking ahead at 2018 and beyond, our capabilities have met my confidence in our ability to capitalize on the significant opportunities present in the market today. And now, I'll turn the call over to Anatol to provide an update on our recent commercial activities and what we're seeing in the market."
1,We enter 2018 on solid footing after the steps we took in 2017 to right-size our cost structure. The implementation of these savings initiatives allows us to continue to invest in our digital capabilities while still delivering improved margins in 2018 and 2019. Moving to head count and other key metrics.
1,"We estimate our 2018 capital spending will be $200 million to $250 million. Leveraging our efficient deployment of capital allows us to maintain our historical level of capital spending while increasing our investment in technology, e-commerce and our people. In line with our continuing transformation agenda, we estimate integration and transformation expenses of $140 million to $180 million in 2018."
1,"We estimate that more than 40% of this company sales will come from its very profitable direct channel, the balance with over 270 stores. The brand is well-positioned with significant opportunity to expand its share within its target demographic focused between the ages of 40 and 65. As Paula likes to say, J."
1,"We estimate this will be roughly $60 million in revenue in 2018. Additionally, the cost savings that we will capture by not building a proprietary MS commercial organization are significant and will allow us to focus our resources on commercial initiatives core to our psychiatry portfolio and on advancing our pipeline. Lastly, with Biogen's established MS commercialization organization, we now model more rapid commercialization of BIIB098."
1,"We exercised 40 options for a MAX 8 firm orders to deliver in 2019 and 2020, deferred 23 MAX 7 firm orders to better align with our future 737-700 retirements, and accelerated 23 MAX 8 firm orders to be 2021 to 2022 timeframe. We will have significant 737-700 NG retirements over the next 10 to 15 years based on their age and this order book refresh, along with our remaining order book and options, which allows us to manage through those retirements in a measured way while allowing flexibility for growth. Aircraft CapEx remains very manageable at approximately $1 billion per year on average for the next five years."
1,"We expect another year of increased advertising spending in 2018, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net sales. We still see significant opportunity to spend behind our core brands, support new product launches, and drive consumption in emerging markets. Now, moving over to the impact of recent U."
1,"We expect commodity inflation, Andrew, to be about 1. 5% and believe that the savings that they're implementing will allow us to offset that nearly completely."
1,"We expect Silvertip to be a slight drag on the company's free cash flow during this initial year of production, our only operation that isn't expected to be free cash flow positive in 2018 due to the investments we're making to achieve commercial production for the drilling and due to a working capital build associated with the timing of concentrate shipments. On the permitting front, we obtained a permit amendment in December that allows us to operate according to our planned ramp-up schedule throughout 2018. During the second quarter, we plan to submit an application for a permit that will allow us to operate at 1,000 metric tons per day, 365 days per year, and we anticipate receiving that permit by year-end."
1,"We expect that the impact of these new developments will be mitigated by the projected growth in the seniors' population and the resulting growing demand in 2018 and beyond. We also believe that the quality of services and care that we offer in our properties, our strong national brand recognition as well as the overall quality of our real estate portfolio will allow us to successfully compete with these new entrants in our markets. The Ontario government recently announced a comprehensive senior strategy, which includes the addition of 5,000 new long-term care beds in the province over the next four years and 30,000 long-term care beds over the next decade."
1,"We expect the second tenant will increase the yields to 13% to 25%. Constructing BTS towers adds to our wireless carrier product suite of small cells and lit and dark fiber backhaul solutions, and allows us to leverage our current customer relationships to cross-sell and bundle with our fiber products. We began building towers in the U."
1,"We expect to close the acquisition of GE Industrial Solutions in the second quarter of this year, which will truly strengthen our number two position in electrification globally and our market share in the extremely important North American market. With our acquisition of machine and factory automation leader, B&R, we filled the historic gap in ABB's portfolio and offer today one of the most comprehensive Industrial Automation portfolios in the industry, which allows us to further strengthen our number two position. And finally, we have expanded our robotics capabilities and portfolio by adding artificial intelligence and machine learning to YuMi and many other functionalities."
1,"We expect to have the opportunity to earn an additional 100 basis points or an increase in return on equity of 100 basis points on the asset here in Ontario and that's the five-year rate filings that you're talking about. It allows us to earn 100 basis points and after that, we share any upside with the rate payer. So, our expectations are still the same, in terms of growth or accretion, that would be in addition to that and that would be growth in LDC side here in Ontario or down in the U."
1,"We expect to pay the reminder of the revolver off in March. So, we begin the life as a public company with a very strong balance sheet, which will allow us to capitalize on opportunities such as we are seeing in our frac rental business along with our other business lines. That covers the financial review, I'll now turn the call back to Scott."
1,"We expect to see material adjusted OIBDAR trend improvements in 2018, and the steps we have taken to improve the maturity profile on our balance sheet has significantly improved our liquidity for the next several years. Importantly, we feel confident in saying that we expect adjusted OIBDAR growth year-over-year in 2019. We are well underway in pivoting the company from a telecom reseller to a cloud application connectivity provider in our Enterprise segment and from a phone and Internet provider to a premium broadband and entertainment provider in our ILEC Consumer and SMB segment."
1,"We expect to utilize Arlington as a platform for change. Not only do we expect to be supplying more targeted finished products of scale, but also the facility will allow us to service our selected customers further down the distribution channel, allowing us to capture additional margin. Our focus currently is on upgrading the structural components of the facility, which is on 18 acres, has over 170,000 square feet of covered storage as well as a seven-car rail siding."
1,"We extended our long-term optical supply partnership with OFS to secure access to a premier supply of optical fiber. This will allow us to develop innovative fiber cabling products for global wireline and wireless networks. We completed the acquisition of Cable Exchange with the goal of continuing to improve our agility, which is a core company value."
1,"We felt that it was time to bring the Retailco employees and operations back into Spark now that these improvements have been fully achieved. We have identified a number of additional synergies in the Retailco reintegration, including redundant management and third party service provider costs that we believe will allow us to achieve as much as $2 million of additional run rate savings from this reintegration, while at the same time, simplifying the story that we communicate to our lenders and our investors. As mentioned in the press release, Keith has agreed to facilitate this reintegration for no consideration and our special committee has approved the transaction."
1,"We filed a shelf registration statement last month, which replaces the prior shelf registration statement that expired this past January. We believe having a shelf on file is an example of good corporate practice and will allow us to act more expeditiously in the future should certain opportunities arise. This completes my financial summary."
1,We focus on the premium end of the spectrum where we can differentiate and where the barriers to entry are the greatest. Our size allows us to be more selective in terms of the sectors of the market where we play while still providing ample headroom for growth and margin expansion. Another advantage to our business is our end market mix.
1,"We fully expect to generate substantial synergies at a run rate of at least $15 million by the end of the second year after close. I can assure you the leadership teams of both companies are committed to helping ensure a smooth transition, and we feel confident that we can achieve the synergies within the timeframe outlined. We will leverage our track record of strong execution to make this combination a great success for all stakeholders."
1,"We fully intend to expand our customer base well beyond these first two customers. The transition of electric vehicles over the coming years will provide significant opportunities for our company. For instance, the anticipated application of 48-volt mild hybrid systems, which one third-party source expects to account for 14% of global new vehicle sales in 2025, will create significant opportunities in the Battery Thermal Management and other battery-related technologies for Gentherm."
1,"We got traction in the first quarter and that's continuing. The second is the margin that we are viewed as being a significant opportunity to improve margins that's coming through not only the integration but cost productivity and then making sure that we're getting price to cost. So, there's a tremendous focus there in how we expand our margins."
1,"We have a lot that's on the roadmap to come out this year that takes the cost to get a home deployed with linear TV down dramatically. Late this year, we'll have the technology that allows us to offer a full linear TV product without a satellite. We're evolving DIRECTV NOW and the software versions of this product."
1,"We have a new team there, the team in the last eight months or nine months. We feel confident in the business, we have there, and we're investing in technology and growth, and they're   a large part of that reports to our new Refrigeration leader Gary Bedard and we're excited about what we can do in there."
1,"We have a proven high-return, low-risk model for our real estate growth. Our flexible real estate model allows us to   the ability to invest in new store growth, enter new markets, deliver new formats and reinvest in our mature store base. We constantly monitor new store productivity and returns to ensure new store growth is the best use of our capital, focusing on the following five metrics; first, new store productivity as a percent of our comp store sales; second, actual sales performance compared to our pro forma model; third, average returns of 20% to 22%, which is an increase compared to our prior target of 18% to 20% due to the benefit of federal tax reform; fourth, cannibalization of our new stores on our comp store base; and finally, a payback period of less than two years."
1,"We have a robust formulation technology platform with two issued patents and several pending. Our operations encompass R&D, manufacturing packaging, quality assurance, and regulatory functions, which allows us to be nimble and responsive, and to adapt to the constantly-changing environment. I would now like to give an update on our various development activities and plans for 2018 and beyond."
1,"We have a strong backlog of uninstalled MRR and our go-to-market investments are working well. Additionally, contact center and SmartWAN represent significant opportunities for new customer growth and upsell. We expect mid-market Enterprise service revenues to grow greater than 25% in 2018."
1,"We have a very clear understanding of the business and the opportunity that lies ahead. We have a defined plan for integration of this business backed into the backhouse systems and other areas in 2018 that will allow us to gain more cost efficiencies for this business, and in 2019, you will see us accelerate the growth for Petsense. Let's talk about the online business for a moment."
1,We have a very resilient diversified business across a number of segments. We see opportunities with Engineering in terms of origination of opportunities for other parts of our business. Melbourne Metro project is a great example of that.
1,"We have a very small optical business, so we've been growing despite the challenging environment for optical. But if we look forward to new products that will be ramping into new customers in the optical environment, we see opportunity for second half growth in optical. And if we get a little bit of stabilization recovery in overall end market, that would be helpful as well."
1,"We have all the critical components required for successful delivery of this transformation. We have solid foundations on which we can build, our strong track record and expertise of delivering large and complex change programs, our experience of building the largest digital bank in the UK, and delivering customer journey transformation, and the experience and dedication of our management team, which will allow us to seize the opportunities that lie ahead. GSR3 represents an exciting opportunity for us."
1,"We have also conducted a very thorough benchmarking exercise, where we are global best practice operating metrics in each of those key areas. That allows us to properly gauge the optimal potential of each asset. As much as we have already squeezed a lot of value out of this portfolio, which is operating better than ever has in most areas, we can see considerable additional value to be added."
1,"We have also conducted a very thorough benchmarking exercise.

As much as we have already squeezed out a lot of value of this portfolio, which is operating better than it ever has in most areas, we can see a considerable additional value that we can add."
1,"We have also moved from the traditional annual investment allocation process to one where investments are reviewed more frequently. This will allow us to adapt to a changing environment and reprioritize if required, depending on customer behavior and market dynamics. On the ground, we are co-locating teams from across the business, bringing together all the capabilities required to deliver the transformation."
1,"We have also worked with them to get better visibility into our movement of the product at the end market. This retail visibility will allow us to rapidly determine the impact of our efforts and adjust them as needed. In addition to growth, the second of the priorities that I will personally own is our program to improve margins."
1,"We have clear destination and being a consumer centric total beverage company, driving an accountable performance driven growth culture and returning to an asset light, high margin and high return business. It allows us to deliver on our long-term targets of top tier revenue growth of 4% to 6%, strong operating leverage driving 6% to 8% operating income growth, driving meaningful EPS growth and then improving on our free cash flow conversion. And with that, I thank you for your attention this morning and we are ready to answer questions."
1,"We have early signs of strong pricing environment in a number of markets. In Russia and other key markets, we see opportunities for continued pricing gains supported by consumer affordability. However, we will defend our position in consumer franchise, if necessary."
1,"We have embarked on an extensive out-licensing effort for our dermatology and ophthalmology franchises, including global exclusive access to our proprietary platform for future exploration and exploitation in those two therapeutic areas. The result of a transaction will provide us with non-dilutive cash that allows us to further accelerate our program in the immuno-oncology and adoptive cell therapy space. One last comment before I turn this call over to Caitlin."
1,"We have financial flexibility that enables strategic and opportunistic actions. We have a significant opportunity to grow both organic and inorganic. We're investing in key areas within our business including technology and people to position us to provide additional value to our clients, which we believe will best position Exela for long-term sustainable growth and to drive shareholder value."
1,"We have gained over 8,000 points of distribution in our initial phase of launch with 50 sub distributors. Our partner, Qifeng Food, is key to our success and one of the reasons we feel confident entering China at this time. Qifeng is a company whose management team is led by senior executives with a strong history of brand development, operations and general management of related beverage sector brands throughout China."
1,"We have had a non-competitive PBM contract over the last few years and have yet still grown our business over 3 million members. And so, if you think about each of our product lines, we see opportunities to grow. We've not been really in the Part D space because of the nature of the contract and we've been uncompetitive there and we see opportunities, and then embedding a much better total cost of care with pharmacy, I think, allows us opportunities across all of our businesses."
1,"We have had nine consecutive quarters of negative traffic driven by a myriad of factors, both internal and external. While we must adapt to macro headwinds, I believe there are significant opportunities well within our control to substantially and significantly improve our performance. Let me be a little more specific and share a few examples."
1,"We have had tremendous success at our spec-suite leasing strategy at 1600 Wilson, which offers $40 rents and is 98% occupied. We feel confident that this strategy will work in Arlington Tower, because there are a limited number of Class A small suites in Rosslyn that offer rents in the $51 to $55 gross range and among those Arlington Tower is the only building with views according to CoStar data. We believe we can achieve a 7% to 10% premium on a TI investment of approximately $80 per foot for our flex products."
1,"We have I think really very carefully analyzed the primary indication for our clinical development program. The fact that the safety of the drug is very good, allows us to move quickly and efficiently. And finally, because we are talking about quite broad spectrum of tumor types, this one here has really a major market potential down the road."
1,"We have innovated in machine learning, we've innovated in analytics, and we've innovated in the cloud. That allows us to then have a bigger partner ecosystem that's building kind of solutions on top of our platform. So we have great respect for HDP Hortonworks."
1,"We have irreplaceable learnings in volumes of field data from multiple, high volume 3D sensing ramps. This, along with our decades of experience supplying laser diodes into the industrial and subsea communication markets allows us to produce high performance, highly reliable volumes of lasers. Our laser chip and manufacturing processes are specifically designed to enable the short design cycles and high volume production ramps needed by the fast pace of consumer electronics customers."
1,"We have long stated a priority for us was the buyout of a business, the Novartis business that we know very well and that we're confident in its outlook, and we wanted to focus within our consumer business on the science-based brands within OTC and Oral Health. By announcing in combination with this deal today, the strategic review of Horlicks, this allows us to maintain the flexibility that we wanted to, to support our other priorities for capital allocation and support our existing profiles, the priority there being pharma R&D. So, hopefully, that answers your question."
1,"We have longstanding relationships with the majority of these borrowers which speaks to our ability to directly originate loans through our platform. The flexibility of our strategy and ability to execute on a variety of financings allows us to be selective and pick the best investments for our portfolio. We customize each financing structure to meet the specific business plans of our borrowers, without compromising on credit protections."
1,"We have made tremendous progress on our EBITDA margin expansion efforts over the past two years and we have ongoing opportunities to significantly improve in this area. Overall, we still have significant opportunities to improve the performance of the business, and we will be attacking them aggressively in 2018. With that, we would now like to open up the call to take your questions."
1,"We have many quality assets that are ready in a corporate structure and they're quality assets. So we are   we're exploring having a publicly traded corp, and in the family of Energy Transfer that will allow us to better access the capital markets and hopefully there will be more to follow on that."
1,"We have more than doubled the number of energy deals that we lead over the last two years. It's been a significant opportunity for us to demonstrate leadership in this space, particularly in deal sizes $500 million or less in total. We compete effectively with anybody in the country a bank of any size."
1,"We have much more comprehensive engagements across all device segments than ever before, creating a platform of learning and optionality that enhances our competitive differentiation and the quality of our earnings. Increased strategic relevance to our customer success creates expectations and also significant opportunity for the company, not least relative to the performance of more than 50,000 Lam process chambers in the global semiconductor installed base today. Our customer service business group grew profitable revenues in 2017 faster than the pace of our installed base growth."
1,"We have not seen weakness in creative. We see opportunity, we see more clients looking for help. Now, what defines creative has evolved."
1,We have our Ovation program which actually started two years ago that   or more than that maybe three or four years ago that deals with people who are looking to exit from their ownership. So we are reconnecting much more heavily with our owners and we also have new technology that will allow us to do that than we didn't have previously. So our voyager system which we talk about for quite some time is now in place that allows us to talk more efficiently and effectively with our owners.
1,"We have recently inaugurated the R&D center at our Bhuj facility. It will allow us to be ahead of the competition in terms of our product offering, innovation to improve the performance of the tire, and thereby expanding our brand. It will also allow us to work closely with OEMs with deeper penetration allowing us to increase our market share."
1,"We have repatriated the first $175 million in cash which we will utilize to enter into an accelerated share repurchase program of $125 million and deploy approximately $50 million for working capital purposes. Further, this legislation allows us to repatriate an additional $200 million in cash tax-free in the future. With the ability to continue to repatriate cash, we also would not expect any significant borrowing on our revolver at year-end 2018."
1,"We have repositioned our troops in front of the new opportunities and 2017 was kind of the proof of this repositioning, and we keep working along those lines. Of course, the base will be a bit more demanding but, well, we see opportunities on the market."
1,"We have strong expectations for this partnership. We think that it will allow us to transform Carrefour in China and therefore, have a more attractive model for our customers, which would create value in China. Coming to Argentina..."
1,"We have taken a differentiated approach in serving our customers and clients with the unique and innovative set of capabilities, all aligned with our mission to improve the health, well-being and sense of security of the people we serve. Our combination with Express Scripts will create significant opportunities and drive increased value for our customers, our clients, healthcare partners, and as a result, our shareholders. We expect significant accretion in year one as a result of our combination with Express Scripts, even after adjusting for the impact of Express Scripts' previously announced transitioning clients."
1,"We have the best customer service, and that's been augmented with the recent rollout of our 2018 Always Getting Better program. We have 240 aircraft on order, which allows us to grow to 200 million passengers by 2024. And the cost gap between Ryanair and our competitors across Europe is widening, and we believe it fundamentally that lowest cost will win in this market."
1,"We have the infrastructure, the asset to keep growing and to keep improving our profit and profitability. Also the financial structure that we have allows us to keep innovative on one end and invest on the other hand. And both categories and geographies that we are working in, we believe that our   the ones that will allow us the future growth."
1,"We have the network, we have the claims processing system, we have the general management in place there in Virginia. So for us, it allows us to create greater capabilities, greater scale in a state which allows us to operate much more efficiently. So that's a positive kind of a thing and Virginia sees it the same way."
1,"We have to do both, we have to grow our top line by investing and we have to continue to grow our operating profit margin, and we see a path for that. We see opportunities to continue to do that. It will not only expand our operating profit margin, but give us the fuel to invest in our brands to grow."
1,"We have to typically move that product to the east or to the west, so there's not a lot of ammonia demand in that area. So what we're trying to do is upgrade more to UAN with this new urea reactor that we're going to be installing that has additional urea capacity, which will allow us to produce more UAN. As far as the ammonia plant, some of the control systems on there, we should be able to run it at a tighter tolerance   tighter operational levels to get the highest production."
1,"We have top tier safety performers which is a continuous focus and the strength of our balance sheet supports our strategic vision. As a result, we expect to capitalize on the significant opportunities ahead and achieve our long-term strategic goals. I'd now like to open the call up for questions."
1,"We have wholesale partner business. In the whole set of building and one other thing that will allow us to decide it or we decided was I now have all networks, all IT and all technology in one place, so of course, I can transform so I get benefits for all of my business unit that means that there is a small and medium business or the enterprise business, we'll enjoy also the unified transport to fiber investments that before has been a little bit separated, and I think that I see a great opportunity to strengthen on enterprise offering, there are small and medium offering and then we decide what type of access do we need for the small and medium, is it 4G or is it 5G or is it fiber or is it DSL or whatever that is the decision on that spot with that market competition et cetera. So I think   I think we can definitely give good support to those type of businesses and that's what we are trying to do and that's the whole Intelligent Edge Network, you're going to see, I'm going to repeat that maintenance."
1,"We have, as you know, a meaningful and growing portfolio of client relationships from National through middle through select segment employers. As it relates to opportunities, as noted multiple times and just to amplify, we see significant opportunities to bring additional value and additional services to both clients, health plans, as well as governmental agencies. I would also add just one final point, if you think about and just visualize, for example, the thousands of employer clients that Express has today, essentially, all of them are multinational clients."
1,"We have, first of all, when the OTC legislation passes, it will allow the use of innovative technologies to allow hearing aids to be fit remotely even by the consumer themselves. And the self-fitting technology coupled with our low power wireless allows us to build an infrastructure that's allows us to create this ecosystem of care linking our call centers in the direct-to-consumer directly to an individual's home or to other accessible locations like drugstores or quick clinics, like MinuteClinics. And we think that's where the future lies for us."
1,"We haven't obviously launched there yet. I think as we move further up into the northeast, there's a lot of population density that allows us to hit many people with more limited logistics infrastructure because the population density is so high. I think we're, other things equal, optimistic about that."
1,"We haven't started that yet. We'd anticipate a program of about six ESPs in the first phase, around three this year in 2018, three in 2019, and that will sort of sustain and offer the potential to continue to grow the production level into 2019 and then, we're shooting the seismic over the whole over the Ceiba/Okume field, which is sort of Block G plus the peripheral Blocks W, S, and EG-21 in 2018, processing it back half of 2018 beginning of 2019 and that will allow us to start a program of drilling where we'll be targeting first the short cycle opportunities whether they're infill wells or whether they're wells which are separate prospects that can be tied back in a short period of time. So as I said in the remarks, we're really pleased with what we're seeing today."
1,"We hope to utilize our cost-effective operating platform and debt management experience to take advantage of opportunities and enhance stockholders' value. In conclusion, we feel confident in the long-term industry fundamentals and are positioned to capitalize future events. I thank you all for joining our call and look forward to reporting on further progress at Pyxis Tankers."
1,"We intend just to be able to pull an aggregate broker-dealer data that it takes to run the broker-dealer in a more efficient manner. So also a cost-effective nature with regard to taking multiple systems and how we've used that to support the broker-dealer and bringing in into one aggregated system that allows us to connect in business processing systems in a much more efficient manner. As we continue to do that, we think we'll continue to experience benefits of things that we started with respect to Project E and that we'll continue to do from a data infrastructure perspective to be able to transact business from an operational side of the house much more smoothly."
1,"We intend to keep our yield at the higher end of the industry. The change in our dividend approach will allow us to significantly increase our share repurchases, which represents a compelling upside investment for the company. We view this as a means to create even more meaningful value for our existing shareholders."
1,"We know we're a dividend play for a lot of investors and we're going to   we're going to maintain our leadership position with that dividend. But at the same time, we believe we've got a significant opportunity based on what you saw here for share repurchase, that's going to be incredibly creative to our shareholder base, and you're going to see us be very active in that market. Gregg?"
1,"We know we're a dividend play for a lot of investors and we're going to maintain our leadership position with that dividend. But at the same time, we believe we've got a significant opportunity based on what you saw here for share repurchase, that's going to be incredibly accretive to our shareholder base, and you're going to see us be very active in that market. Gregg?"
1,"We know what pays back. And we are right now investing only in territories where we have   we see opportunities and where we have a good market access. Of course, with those new market access agreements, this is opening up for new and interesting regions."
1,"We launched   in 7-Eleven now about two and a half years ago, and it shows you that the product is turning well to have them continue to partner with CELSIUS. We are in all their DCs with our core line, and by having CELSIUS HEAT now entered into the 7-Eleven system, that allows us to gain placement in over 22 of their DCs. So, we will go after that, we will leverage that and be able to gain additional placements throughout the country."
1,"We launched our New World Fossil initiative late in 2016 and are well on our way to deliver our $200 million savings target. Our teams across the globe have done a tremendous job of rallying behind these significant opportunities. Moving into 2018, we are looking to aggressively expand those efforts to further drive efficiencies in our model and be more focused on our consumers."
1,"We like what we're seeing in our early results with our Slimvance launch that Ken mentioned. And after considering the one-time impacts of the change in the business model in 2017, we feel confident that in 2018, we can certainly capitalize in the industry strength and the growth that's expected and our ability to deliver and execute on the initiatives that Ken mentioned."
1,"We made big investments to expand our sales coverage. The channel program, big piece of that, frees up a lot of resource, allows us to incorporate the agents into our global program much more effectively, enables them to start driving growth. And then, we've made all the investments we think is necessary to enable, once we connected with those customers and they're now in our portfolio, that the ability to sell into and to retain from a renewable standpoint, makes it a very strong predictable revenue stream going forward."
1,We make decisions every day about discounts and everything you have to do in this crazy world that we live in. But 4% to 5% is a good range and it will allow us to grow and it makes us very competitive even with our largest competitors.
1,"We may find ourselves doing fairly little in 2018, it may be a lot, it really depends on the deals. As it stands, the balance sheet allows us to do a significant volume of deals but we're not going to do deals just for the sake of doing deals and growing the balance sheet. Asset rotation, yes, it will continue."
1,"We may not hit the goal every time, but we'll always look for these opportunities that seem to make sense where we have a good fit; and in each of these states is a different kind of a political process, and a different development of where they are in the kind of the managed care spectrum of being more or less aggressive, how experienced they are. We may or we may not prevail, but again, when we see there's an opportunity, we'll typically develop the relationship and apply our skills hopefully in a way that allows us to be successful."
1,"We more than doubled our DEF capacity at IFCo in the beginning of 2018 to 820,000 tons and successfully produced diesel exhaust fluid in Egypt with the first shipments sold in February. Finally, all our facilities are all strategically located in premium commanding locations close to our end customers and with abundant access to sustainably low cost gas, which allows us to benefit from a leading position on the global cost curve and achieve optimal netbacks. To conclude, this ramp-up serves us well under any market conditions."
1,"We needed to procure multiple land parcels concurrently ahead of construction and did not want to be long on land and short on equity. In order to capture the value creation of this pipeline, while maintaining our balance sheet flexibility and eliminating market risk, we structured a forward equity transaction, which, much like an ATM, allows us to match fund development costs but at a protected share price that locked in NAV accretion. As summarized on slide 7, the DoD's base budget authority bottomed in fiscal year 2015 and has increased 7% over the last two years."
1,We now have 100% of our Search teams trained on this new assessment methodology and are actively implementing with clients globally. And we have begun rolling out a new client portal solution which allows us to digitally engage with the leading organizations we serve. We showcased this new capability to a number of client executives at Davos and their response was overwhelming.
1,"We now have just over $1 billion of capital which provides us the ability to fund the business to at least the end of 2020. This financial strength will allow us to focus on the execution of a number of important value-driving activities over this timeframe, including our planned ivosidenib launch later this year, clinical trials required to secure labels for ivosidenib in frontline AML and cholangiocarcinoma, further evaluation of the role of our IDH-mutant inhibitors in low-grade glioma, two pivotal trials of AG-348 for PK deficiency, exploration of the role of PK activation in thalassemia and other hemolytic anemias, clinical development of AG-270, IND-enabling activities in early clinical development of our DHODH inhibitor, all while maintaining investment in our productive discovery research engine, which we expect to deliver multiply INDs in this timeframe. We are pleased with our ability to appropriately invest across the business, and thank all of our investors for their support."
1,"We now have much more capability and data available to give us color in what we can do. And both in tables, as well as in slots around the classing of product, the location of product, and I think that is a very significant opportunity for us. It's a very significant opportunity for the whole sector."
1,"We outlined for you a roughly 70-basis-point reduction in the capital ratios related to that. Having strong capital positions to deploy for our clients and wherever we see opportunities is a crucial part of our strategy. And so, that's why we're thinking about the pace that we outlined for you, $5 billion to $6 billion, similar to what we've done in the past few years."
1,"We plan on further reducing our losses this upcoming year through better store productivity, operational efficiencies and additional store conversions. Overall, looking ahead to 2019 and beyond, we continue to see a significant opportunity for us to continue to grow our business and to be the partner of choice for our department stores as well as our licensors. The depth and breadth of choice available to the consumers is unprecedented."
1,"We plan to finance this acquisition with an incremental first lien Term Loan B, which we will raise prior to the acquisition closing. The acquisition includes a 338(h)(10) election, which will allow us to step up Lifetouch assets to fair value, decreasing future taxable income for the combined company. Post this acquisition, we will have pro forma adjusted total debt of $1."
1,"We plan to start with France and Germany, countries where there is a reimbursement path and are in the process of identifying early access sites to conduct validation studies to support launching in these countries in 2019. Beyond these first two markets, the IVD technology allows us to consider entering even larger markets in the future, like China. It also opens the door to expanded pharmaceutical collaborations to partner on global clinical trials."
1,"We plan to use the remaining funds for exploratory activities, specifically seismic data acquisition. In a nutshell and to end my part, this last year we adopted a number of relevant measures, which generated value to our shareholders, more than that we significantly strengthened our financial position, which will allow us to invest in high quality project and to continue to optimize our asset portfolio generating value to our shareholders. Now I would like to turn the call back to Lincoln to continue the presentation."
1,"We pride ourselves of the fact that we have both some larger contracts coming into the portfolio, because those speak of the impact of our strategy and our ability to drive different client work. But quite frankly, we're equally proud of the fact that we work with clients at all different sizes and that our portfolio itself is both quite diversified by design, that gives us what we believe is   it allows us to manage uncertainty, it allows us to drive both pricing and profitability, and we wouldn't have it any other way. So I think the portfolio and the pipeline, again, support the notion that all elements are in place for this notion of sustainable quality growth that we have been talking to our analysts and our investors now for many years."
1,"We qualified new suppliers, more suppliers. That means we have obviously a bigger variety of opportunities and this allows us to catch up now, to not losing, on top of what we have already but now we are recovering and we will be back on track. And that's the reason why we increased our outlook for revenue and sales."
1,"We quickly seized on the opportunity and have already completed the expansion which is fully leased. Looking ahead, there are a number of additional opportunities to continue increasing cash flow through releasing below market space as well as potential significant opportunities down the road involving key anchor tenants that are looking to expand their stores. Perhaps, the most important aspect of our 2017 acquisitions is their location attributes, as omni-channel retailing continues to have an increasing impact on bricks and mortar stores, having shopping centers ideally situated and sought after markets is more important today than it's ever been in our industry."
1,"We recently acquired Nanocomp Technologies, which is a small technology acquisition, the financial details of which we do not intend to disclose. A key component of the Advanced Materials growth strategy is to add formulations and technology to our portfolio that allows us to expand in our existing markets and to access new markets. We can bring effects that our customers value and they're willing to pay for."
1,"We recently did the Big Universe acquisition, also helps expand the product bag. So it allows us to offer some lower price supplemental products to help round out the bag a little bit. While we are still certainly very bullish about our aggregate product set is that, from a breadth perspective, we just have, what, no one else we believe really has in terms of comprehensiveness kind of world-class, world language programs."
1,"We recently launched an initiative within each sales region to win broadband opportunities and we are excited about the potential for this new program. There is still a significant opportunity to expand share in this market and we look forward to building on our progress in future quarters. In the private system operator market, revenues and gross profit both grew 8% from a year ago."
1,"We recently leveraged technology to enhance our team member training and development platform that has already allowed us to deliver strong performance in regards to turnover. With these enhancements I mentioned, will allow us to improve employee retention along with continuing to provide a superior guest experience and widen the gap between us and our competitors. Our second and arguably most important theme going forward revolves around our plans to make the Habit, dining at the Habit more convenient for our loyal customers and we have some exciting announcements today."
1,"We recognize through our research with consumers, most of them are not aware of this. We have not advertised this aggressively enough, and there's a significant opportunity to drive engagement and adoption through further awareness."
1,"We refinanced the company, and net debt was well inside our target of 2 times EBITDA. And this allows us to deliver a growing and sustainable dividend and the aforementioned share buyback program. At our Capital Markets Day in June of last year, we laid out our ambition of delivering more than Â£425 million of EBITDA by 2025."
1,"We remain   our conviction that the miraDry business will be a strong revenue growth driver for the company moving into 2018 and beyond, as we continue to augment our sales team, launch our marketing initiatives to drive demand from the bottom up, and search for a permanent general manager of this Miramar group. As we look beyond our current offerings, I would like to once again reiterate that we   significant opportunity to further expand our current total addressable market, which consists of the $400 million U. S."
1,"We saw momentum pick up as we moved through the quarter and expect to return to growth with the help of our strong pipeline. Given the significant opportunity we see, the Intelligent Edge is the key area of investment for us and our innovation continues to be recognized in the market. For example, in January, Aruba ClearPass was the first in the industry to be awarded Common Criteria certification by the National Information Assurance Partnership."
1,"We see good opportunity in Healthcare & Seniors in particular and hence, the acquisition we've made in that sector. And I think the business model that we've got, which is sector and multi-sector or subsector-based with the scale that we get through food by the leverage in MAP 5 will allow us to maintain and hopefully extend our market position. So we remain just very positive on the North American performance."
1,"We see it as an enabler to get more reach and the ability to sit in facilities that where we were not so maybe attractive historically, and I specifically refer to data centers, larger data centers that operators use or OTT providers use. So, now, we have a new tool that will allow us to be more attractive in those kinds of scenarios. We have also now an origin offering that does not require our own hardware, which can also run in a data center potentially in a virtualized environment."
1,"We see partnering as a way to maximize the value of our technology. It allows us to focus our internal development resources on our lead candidates and also gives us exposure to additional high-value opportunities that may be beyond the reach of a small biotech company. In addition, partnering can be an important source of capital that can supplement our need to access the capital markets."
1,"We see that rate of incline coming down a little bit. And the second is that, as Paul mentioned, we see opportunities to take cost out of OpEx, for instance, in some of the supporting functions, thinking about shared services, thinking about consolidations. And we are going to reinvest that into OpEx, in front line and into R&D."
1,"We spent a good deal of time together talking about the business. Obviously, from an Intact perspective, about 18 to 20 months ago, they had set out on establishing a specialized focus here in Canada, and this would just augment that in a significant way and as well give us opportunities to work on business both in each country as well as cross-border, which is a significant opportunity given the trading relationship between the companies. But I think the key elements were the focus and interest of Intact to expand in specialty markets outside of Canada, number one; and number two, really, the values alignment of the companies."
1,"We stand apart in the industry as a high-tech innovative aerospace and defense company whose very structure is designed to enhance entrepreneurship. We have a lean corporate structure and minimal bureaucracy, which allows us to move quicker than our competition. To successfully execute our strategy, we're going to integrate and collaborate more to make effective use of our strength."
1,"We started building out federal team roughly a year ago. We do believe there's a significant opportunity. The thing that has changed for us as we see cloud play a big role in federal agencies as they think about future computing infrastructure, and we think we can be a participant in that evolution of the cloud."
1,"We still have about half of our material that we source out of high-cost countries. In factories, there is I think significant opportunities to continue to implement that Six Sigma Lean philosophy and concept as well as, obviously, now that the Sheppard world has joined WABCO, I think there are even more opportunities in Sheppard to create a significant improvement in the cost structure. So, it's an every year challenge."
1,"We still have some room to improve that Office 365 Commercial gross margin from the new workloads we've added, which have even more of those pure SaaS-like workloads. And aside from Office in that same segment is Dynamics who, or LinkedIn, which both have those SaaS-like margins and can and we see opportunity to both improve those as well. So I don't think there's necessarily a level, but there's certainly room even within these storage-heavy workloads."
1,"We strongly believe that EchoStar is one of those companies. We have the premier balance sheet in the industry, which allows us to be extremely flexible and responsive on how we pursue other growth opportunities, both organic and non-organic. With the technology and engineering resources within the Hughes' organization, we have the capabilities and knowhow to be a major player as network development and integration play out."
1,"We successfully renewed our Block 9 contract and we recently signed an exploration and production sharing contract for Block 30, which enhances our position. We see opportunities for gas production in the area and synergies with our adjacent position in Block 62. I'd like to highlight the performance of several projects in Colombia."
1,"We take pride in the breadth and strengths of our IoT offerings, and we believe our expected growth in revenues and margins combined with our relentless operational discipline will generate free cash flow and build on an already strong balance sheet. This combination allows us to pursue both organic and inorganic opportunities to further accelerate Digi's strategy and business. Now, I will turn it over to Mike for more detail on our performance in the first fiscal quarter of 2018, and our expectations for the second fiscal quarter and updated full-year guidance."
1,"We take the assets we own and we share them among multiple customers. If any one of those customers will try to build those assets themselves, build one tower themselves, it would be more expensive for that customer to do so than what we charge them because we only charge them a portion and we have multiple customers and allows us to make money, saves them money, that's what we want to try to replicate over time in any business we are to be a passive infrastructure   shared infrastructure provider. So, those are my prepared remarks."
1,We tend to obviously give you where we see comp sales currently. I'd like to think of that the initiatives and things that we put in place will allow us to stay on the positive side in regards to those comp sales.
1,"We think 2020 is going to be another terrific year in San Francisco. So we made a decision to pull the renovation forward and to put us in a position so that we can participate in the growth in San Francisco with a really truly reinvented hotel, which we believe will allow us to significantly increase our yield index in the property and drive more cash flow to the bottom line. The incremental disruption this year as a result of doing that, which is already included in our guidance, is about $5 million."
1,"We think in term of pricing, we are more in an effort to try to be more pricing, I would say, disciplined than go for price liberality. So, we see opportunities in Europe where we're going to be able to be much more disciplined on pricing. This is clearly an opportunity for Renault."
1,"We think it's amazing how much storage these devices can hold when you look back a few years and the utilization that people get out of it. We also think that our position with our advanced 3D NAND technology coupled with our die stacking packaging capability will allow us to deliver these denser, higher capacity NAND modules into the smartphone market in a way that will not upset the overall BOM constraints of the smartphone manufacturers. So we think whether it's the end of this year or in the next year that it's going to be more about the ability to deliver it in a cost effective way for that particular capacity point."
1,"We think our release in May will give us a best-in-class recruiting solution that we can use to penetrate our installed base and keep selling to new prospects around the world. And thirdly, as Vincent talked about, we're seeing significant opportunity over time to emerge as a global player in human capital management, leveraging the success we've seen in Europe around Cornerstone HR to grow a competitive offering that truly is taking a Blue Ocean Strategy to this area where we're going after not the current choices of ripping and replacing, we're doing nothing, but rather going after the opportunity to layer on top of existing HR investments to provide a modern HR infrastructure to the organizations that we already work with. And so when I think about why we have this team ready to come out and perform and what keeps us excited about the opportunity that we see, it's not just about being a player in human capital management."
1,"We think that spine cases are not going away. And when you talk to the surgeons, I think they'll tell you that in some instances maybe around that Q3 time that there may have been some headwind, but if you look at our Q4 experience and so forth going into the year, we feel confident about the market and the overall health of the spine market."
1,"We think that'll really help your viability, it'll help your growth traction, and it'll allow you to attract the capital you need to execute on your commercialization plans. And we would always tell them throughout 2017 we feel confident. But when we got it and then we put a good amount of capital on the balance sheet, it really allows us to not having any impediments to go out and execute on our plan."
1,We think that's important because it broadens our customer base. It allows us to give to our customers what it is they need. In addition we started construction on our first two Aspire villages and we've talked about these before.
1,"We think there's no other market as attractive as what we're in terms of and what we're good at. And to the degree that we see opportunity to keep investing towards that, we want to signal the intent that's what we'd like to do. So I think there's always a potential to accelerate the margin growth in this type of business."
1,"We think there's upside here as well, we try to be conservative in our approach. We're bullish on opportunities to work with the brands and other folks to, as I said, minimize margin erosion and, of course, having the affiliated operator here allows us to work very closely with them on all initiatives and all those fronts. So with that, we'll move forward and look forward to speaking with you next time."
1,"We think we made some operational errors in our digital business that we're looking at improving and fixing as we move forward. And again, we think there is significant opportunity in digital as we move forward."
1,"We think with ICE4 upgrade opportunities, we have a huge installed base of customers. And the cadence of when they will decide to upgrade, because I'm pretty sure they're going to upgrade, and how long it takes to qualify, really gives us some significant opportunity, but it's dependent upon when they want to qualify. Clearly, as we started to ship ICE4 in what I would consider the integrated systems path in Q1, we see a remarkable amount of customers starting to plan upgrades, but only a few of them right now have specific plans."
1,"We took 17 out of 21 licenses in the local license auctions. That will allow us to basically grow market share on share of listening in the terms of double-digit percentages. So, that could be very, very strong organic opportunity for us."
1,"We took both of our CTOs from Microdevices and nanotron out of the day-to-day engineering management and allowed them to focus on what is next. This will allow us to execute better the product schedules with dedicated engineering leadership, as well as deliver products with our combined expertise in IP. The first collaboration between the teams will be some sensors that are based off of our Microdevice IP and combined with the nanotron radio technology."
1,"We truly believe that we can be more productive in our investment strategy by standardizing assets by being rigorous when it comes to renegotiating mass purchasing contracts for all of our territories. And this will allow us to have a network of stores of great quality. So, the idea is not for the quality of our services to decrease, but we want to invest in highly promising formats, such as the convenience store format, for example."
1,"We want to be able to clearly demonstrate our products superiority by engaging directly with bartenders and liquid store owners in key markets with the help of our new distributor partners. To summarize, we've made very good progress on our transformation today, and we have significant opportunities to continue to capture moving forward. We've already stemmed the sale declines with our early initiatives, begun to improve margins, received LOI to sell the plant and raise the capital necessary to enhance our balance sheet and support our plans."
1,"We want to keep consolidating our industry with a clear focus to capture synergies and promote our growth. And finally, and maybe most importantly our ability to transform ourselves and develop new products, which will allows us to advance along the value chain and grow with the clients. These new products will enlarge our market These new products will enlarge our market and allow us to keep our growth momentum."
1,"We want to make sure we're finding the right assets at the right price with the right fit. But when we can find complementary capabilities that help plug holes in what we do that will allow us to expand our footprint with both new and existing customers, that's job one. We're in a great industry, it's early days and we should be looking for these kinds of tuck-in acquisitions to help accelerate growth and accelerate our positioning."
1,"We wanted this year to really be focused also on building our pipeline and so we took R&D up to basically support all these great initiatives that we have. And we think that's a prudent investment, but also one that will allow us to improve profitability. Things like TandemLife, actually improve our gross margin more than other parts of the business."
1,"We wanted to make sure that regardless of where Toshiba memory ended up from an equity standpoint, from a transaction standpoint, from customers participating that what had been so successful for 17 years stayed successful as we extended the JV relationship out to 2029. So we feel good about that, we feel that the ability for anyone to interfere regardless of their position is now protected and our ability to continue jointly developing the technology, which we've done a lot of people during the process may be lost sight of the fact that, it's not just a financing relationship, it's a fantastic financing relationship that allows us access to pretty low cost financing, and allows us to get to a similar scale as Samsung and get all the benefits of that. But it's also a technology collaboration where our teams take turns, designing the chips we do tick-tock."
1,"We were able to power through the downturn, maintained our distribution. And look where we are today; we're in the process of announcing a major acquisition which will allow us to further improve our coverage, to further delever our balance sheet, and maintain the stability of cash flows for you, our investors, moving forward. We have long relationships with the core customers and suppliers, Caterpillar and Ariel on the manufacturing side."
1,"We were building a platform and we have very strong free cash flow conversion. 70% to 80% free cash flow conversion which would be adjusted EBITDA minus CapEx and it will allow us to grow in new markets and, as Chris said, self-fund a lot of our growth."
1,"We will be the biggest premium brand by doing this. I think we probably are already and this will allow us to get a much higher level of brand awareness in that space which is obviously a very good space intensive defensive position against new entrants including digital entrants because it's all about the quality of your product and the quality of your people. So, yes, it's definitely the side of strategy which as I said we'll start pursuing in America with Liberty."
1,"We will be the biggest premium brand by doing this. I think we probably are already, and this will allow us to get a much higher level of brand awareness in that space, which is obviously a very good space in terms of defensive position against new entrants, including digital entrants because it's all about the quality of your product and the quality of your people. So, yes, it's definitely the side of strategy, which as I said we're all start pursuing in America with Liberty."
1,"We will be upgrading our existing digital loan application platform, utilizing leading architecture, which will further streamline the customer experience by significantly reducing the customers' effort to get a loan. A new loan app will also capture key data that will allow us to rapidly test and learn what application methodology and formats delivers the optimal customer experience and maximize the ratio of started apps to funded loans. We believe that this investment will increase the volume and ultimately drive increased conversion rates."
1,"We will build on our progress to-date and seek to hasten our efforts to drive market share and focus investment on the most attractive revenue opportunities, while increasing operating efficiencies. This will allow us to continue to transition into a leaner, more efficient organization that is better positioned to drive margin expansion and create long-term shareholder value. Looking at each of the components, starting in Software, our focus is centered on evaluating our current offerings through product lifecycle management and realigning resources, best optimizing our portfolio."
1,"We will continue to build on our strong customer relationships and develop leading-edge technology to support our customers. Our portfolio allows us to deliver strong and consistent operating cash flow, requires less capital intensity, and we expect to be more resilient to overall shifts in the economic activity. We also continued our strong cash generation with about $1."
1,"We will continue to drive very targeted investments in broadband, as well as focusing on those international growth opportunities as they make sense. And then certainly, further simplifying the business operations to drive greater efficiency and process simplification, will allow us to drive greater reuse from a portfolio perspective and drive additional leverage in terms of the investments that we're making around the globe. So with that, I think I'm done and, Bob, I believe we have a break."
1,"We will continue to evaluate all growth opportunities as we move forward. As I've said in the past, the franchise business is all about scale as this allows us to spread our costs over a larger number of units. The incremental value of each unit added has 90% plus flow through to our bottom line."
1,"We will continue to invest in our Specialty Products and expect continued improvement in those penetration rates in the years to come. While we have significant opportunities in 2018, another key priority during my first 60 days in Anthem has been to align the organization around plans to develop a long-term strategy, focused on accelerating our top-line and bottom-line growth. We need to augment our recent successes in Commercial fee business and Medicaid with stronger, profitable growth in higher revenue businesses."
1,"We will continue to pursue margin expansion through improving our business processes and our execution on affordability initiatives. And over the coming years, we see significant opportunities both organic and through acquisition for continued growth in Medicare and Medicaid. States and the federal government now more than ever are looking for ways to provide access to quality healthcare for their constituents while effectively managing costs."
1,"We will execute the spin of our Homes business and set them up for success. We've operationalized an aggressive plan to grow revenue better than markets and to enter markets with significant opportunities to grow and expand our margins. This will be delivered thorough our connected solutions and offerings tied to the long-term megatrends of urbanization, clear air and water and energy efficiency, and we'll also continue to grow in our core business and our high growth regions."
1,"We will have three sources of underground ore prior to the shaft going in, which bumps production. But this is mainly a long-term decision that allows us to open up the lower part of the ore body and add to the reserve and resource base."
1,"We will in fact increase our investment in R&D, as both Alex and I mentioned. That's a bit of a headwind on overall margin improvement, but we feel confident that, at about 100 basis points improvement, which we'll see that throughout 2018. As far as how it meters by quarter, that all depends because we   as I mentioned earlier to an earlier question, we tend to redeploy, reinvest the gains from various divestitures back into the business and make incremental investments accordingly."
1,"We will invest more and improving our asset management plans for each and every community to fully optimize our capital allocation and value creation. Over the next 10 to 15 years, our new minimum distribution policy will allow us to invest in strategic locations, with significant NAV growth potential and increase our geographic diversification to a future target portfolio of 50% west and 50% east each in high-growth undersupplied market. We will continue to strive to maintain a conservative balance sheet, carefully allocating capital for NAV growth opportunity."
1,We will leverage these improved clinical capabilities to manage the health of our current members as well as drive increased membership growth in the future. One area we see opportunity for growth is the D-SNP population. We are seeing certain states begin to make a greater link between Medicare and Medicaid Long-Term Support Service capabilities for the D-SNP population.
1,"We will now include unlimited mobile data to allow our customers to surf carefree anytime, anywhere they want, without having to worry about their Internet use anymore. This new offer is perfectly in line with our value management and our strategy to monetize mobile data, because it will allow us to further improve the customer mix between the low, mid and high-end offers. This offer can also be combined with convergent with the LOVE offer, and as such provide the first full unlimited package, voice call, SMS, mobile data, fixed Internet and TV for only â‚¬79 per month."
1,"We will provide more detail on these notable items later in the call, but we believe both will benefit our company and our shareholders. The Anchor transaction represents a continued simplification of the BPFH business model and allows us to focus attention and resources on our Wealth Management, Trust, and Private Banking businesses. This deal creates capital flexibility by transforming goodwill and intangible assets into tangible common equity."
1,"We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneur mindset is the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders. With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO for his review of our fourth quarter results."
1,We will repurpose the Redwater plant and expand our ammonium sulfate production capturing higher margin markets. This will allow us to use unutilized capacity at Aurora and White Springs and drive down our per unit cost very significantly. We also save on capital and on environmental costs by now operating only two phosphate facilities.
1,"We will use the remainder of the proceeds from the offering and the funds available under the revolver to expand our consumer loans portfolio. We anticipate this financing, coupled with the cash generated by our strong net income, will allow us to grow our loan book into 2019. Our strong financial performance and balance sheet, coupled with our outlook for the future, has given our board the confidence to increase our quarterly dividend by 25% to CAD 0."
1,"We'll also have the option to draw an additional $10 million tranch within the next 12 months. Having the flexibility in what we initially and ultimately draw was very important to us, as it allows us to optimize our level of debt based on our needs. Our strengthened finance team also made significant strides remediating the material weaknesses that the company identified during 2016."
1,"We'll find creative solutions to do more with less. We began our efforts in 2017 and have plans in place to deliver savings in 2018 as there continues to be a significant opportunity. Our efforts contributed to a slowing of expense growth in 2017, despite increased strategic spend and higher expenses from areas where we see the most potential."
1,"We'll have a different strategy probably for each one, each presents a unique opportunity, and we're devising those strategies as we   kind of as we sit here. There's influence on the strategy about where cap rates are, and what the purchase option discount will allow us to buy them on. So I know, I'm giving you sort of the squarely answer on this, but it's evolving and they will definitely at the end of the day contribute significant value to us in 2018."
1,"We'll have potentially some increase in our cost of goods sold just because that's where some of our service operations investment will appear and we've got obviously a complex mix between harvest brands and invest brands. We will absolutely increase our sales and marketing investment as we see opportunities to generate long-term value via customer acquisition and we're very focused on striking the balance of building the customer experience across each of these different areas I've emphasized and so, customer experience falls into just onboarding a customer as an example. How they get treated at a renewal, how they get treated during their life time if something breaks."
1,"We'll have to wait and see what the impact is on both the commercial and Medicaid business. But as I stated in our Investor Day, longer-term, we see opportunity in the Medicaid business. On the commercial side, it really depends on the competitive dynamics."
1,"Well I am personally excited about both of those and a few others because I see significant opportunities for us to take our assets, which relate to content sets as well analytical algorithms, mathematical tools, as well as technology platform capabilities to combine the information with the technology tools to drive significant value. And I see significant opportunity to do that over time, and you asked about insurance globally, and I see significant opportunities on the other sort of risk side."
1,"We'll invest heavily this year as I just mentioned in new construction and on improvements at our existing plants. Those improvements will allow us to take advantage of some efficiency gains, improve product quality and improve food safety. The lower tax rate might allow us to accelerate our pace, but our strategy has not changed."
1,"Well, a lot of it is based on the success of those each individual company. Elementum is a company that's building a SaaS-based software supply chain solution, and its ability to book and continue to grow revenue rapidly is going to create significant opportunity for us just in terms of capital appreciation. So, that is the biggest opportunity that you would see out of Elementum."
1,"Well, as I think you heard from Vim on his session, we see open banking as a significant opportunity. And we have already implemented, and as I said, the first of the big banks to implement it."
1,"Well, as we've said   stated previously, we plan to accelerate our growth and marketing spend meaningfully in this upcoming fiscal 2019 which, of course, we're going to begin next month in April. Our current cash position and our access to our credit facility will allow us to accelerate our growth and our marketing spend through fiscal 2019 without needing to raise additional equity. In addition, we still expect to get to breakeven profitability sometime in the second half of this upcoming fiscal year even with the elevated marketing spend."
1,"Well, data warehouse is a significant opportunity."
1,"Well, for customers, it's a lighter, easier and more natural path to getting value out of a product before having to commit to a contract. For HubSpot, it allows us to sell to users, people who are actually using the product and getting value out of it as opposed to leads. This helps lower our overall cost to acquire a customer, an important component of our customer unit economics and a metric we obsess over here at HubSpot."
1,"Well, I don't know about the low hanging fruit, but I would say that there's a broad swath of what I'd say is the smaller to midsize Medicaid plans, most of them regional, some of them like in California county base, that just haven't had the attention from the more sophisticated vendors and analytics companies like ourselves to deliver these consumer engagement solutions, whether it's an electronics health risk assessment, which by the way we have a very strong closure rate on and that's very good to get that data electronically, then determine where do you really need to do a physical assessment. So anything between that to member satisfaction and retention to all of the 200-plus programs that Eliza offers, we see that market as a significant opportunity because they're just underserved. Obviously all of the players in this space have focused on the bigs and Eliza did as HMS did when we first entered the commercial space."
1,"Well, I mean I think, first of all, in the near-term here it's really about the size and our current financial position, Jonas, and I think one of the things that's important for everyone to remember, is that we're going to be opportunistic. And if we see an opportunity to do whatever it is that's value creating, I think our position allows us to do that. So I don't know that this is kind of contrary to what we've said."
1,"Well, I think as we talked about this in November, we gave you our best estimate and we've continued to refine that and add in some of the incremental risks from a topline perspective, primarily volume in France and to a lesser extent in Norway. So I think our guidance is what we feel confident in being able to achieve with all those in place. And just by way of estimate, we probably see that probably towards that top end of that range that we'd previously guided towards, the 2% to 3%."
1,"Well, I think that the real theme around demand is again the need for data, the need for the experience, the need for mobile connectivity at a higher level, higher speed, higher performance. We see that trend continuing and we're actually seeing a challenge getting steeper and more difficult, which actually allows us to outperform. Markets like China, I have an example with Huawei, I showed you Oppo, vivo."
1,"Well, I think that we've got   first of all, we   obviously, we don't provide forward-looking guidance, but I think the way that we look at our brand support is we are looking at our brand support in terms of market mix modeling and looking at it in terms of how can we shift our marketing mix to drive greater returns from each dollar we're investing. And we see opportunities to do that. The absolute level of brand support that we're going to spend depends on what we need to do to be competitive in the market, and what we think is the appropriate level to drive the brand appeal with consumers."
1,"Well, I think we see in front of us a pretty significant opportunity. Having said that, there are sort of some forces that are at play here."
1,"Well, I think, first and foremost, the   one of the things that we're spending some time evaluating because there's a lot of great opportunity out in the marketplace today is, we're making some good strategic investments in our distribution channel. So, we see opportunities   those are really more about investments for 2019 revenue as opposed to meaningful contributions immediately for 2018. But we wanted to leave some room for us to continue to invest for the future opportunities that we see."
1,"Well, I'm not breaking out by brand, but we're going to bring down the inventories at total Tailored Brands in the high-single-digits this year. So, we see opportunity to continue to get more efficient."
1,"Well, in terms of the growth of volume of transporting materials by Ferrosur, in terms of cement, stone, our forecast is similar to Loma Negra, to what we're handling today, 6%, and   but we do see a major growth in frac sand shipping. Well, we need to bear in mind that shipping of frac sand for the Vaca Muerta project implies longer extensions in kilometers at a better price, so that allows us to have higher profitability."
1,"Well, it's bridging two suppliers, okay, that we want to bring forward. And what it allows us to do is have an additional supplier to maximize the supply chain, so that we can have a   what we're anticipating is obviously a highly successful launch into a big marketplace and we want to make sure that we don't come up short. So, that's really what it's about."
1,"Well, it's really a matter of size. So, larger opportunities are outside of the stretch of how comfortable we are in terms of the amount of capital that we will deploy and this vehicle allows us to work with other third-party capital providers. So, this is not just a partnership with RenRe."
1,"Well, so, Sean, on any of the bigger components of our non-core assets, we continue to look at opportunities that will allow us to capitalize on a differential between how the market values those assets versus how they value specialty lumber producers. So we're actively in a process and I really won't comment more than that."
1,"Well, to your point, we think that there's a significant opportunity for us to continue to invest against the specialty product lines that are coming out every day. At this conference, it's impossible to not know there's a significant innovation that's under way."
1,"Well, today, the cash balance sort of on a pro forma basis, our war chest is over $600 million and that allows us to get through obviously our BLA filing, approval, launch and into 2020."
1,"Well, we haven't chosen the exact date yet, but we believe it'll be sometime   around the beginning of the fourth quarter, and most likely in New York. And what we're excited about though is that we not only will be able to talk more about 2018, but I think we'll be able to share with you some of the initiatives that we're looking at as well in different spaces like, for example, you might notice, as the year progresses this year, that our plan allows us to pursue additional spending in the innovation area. And so, we are really focused on a couple of different avenues here at both process improvements, as well as product improvement and innovation."
1,"Well, we obviously have an LDMOS business that's coming over and we'll support that and work with customers. We've got a great relationship with the broader Infineon company and so the supply agreement will allow us to address the LDMOS portion of this business for years to come. So, no issue there."
1,"Well, we're always   as I'd said, we're always going to prioritize growth because we see opportunities. We have the good fortune of being in an asset   relatively asset-light business or from our own color, organic growth scenario versus other oilfield entities."
1,"Well, we've been developing plans internally to, I don't want to call it a cookie-cutter model, but we have a model now internally that allows us to operationalize and launch a new market better, faster, cheaper than we have been doing in the past. We have 41 countries today, but I can tell you that that's not going to be the case at the end of this year and you'll see a slight acceleration in the pace that we're opening up new markets."
1,"We're also improving our base and variable compensation packages to continue to be competitive in the labor market. We expect these investments will allow us to continue to be at the forefront of product innovation in the enterprise, analytics and mobility business. General and administrative expenses increased $4."
1,"We're also seeing exciting growth of our Laundry website that we launched this past fall. The newly added ecommerce segment of our business allows us to showcase the image of the Laundry brand, while featuring our broadened product assortment in multiple categories. We expect this effort to drive brand awareness and sales."
1,"We're assessing that. As you know, tax reform will allow us to access cash that was overseas for some period of time. That may change the geography of M&A, but I think the philosophy will remain largely where it's been."
1,"We're bringing new value to clients based on our core shipping and mailing capabilities, helping them navigate what is an increasingly complex environment in and of itself. We've created an open platform and an open strategy that allows us to create new relationships with our clients and with partners that fundamentally allows us to create a new platform for value creation. And third, we're building a community of partners and developers who can identify with us opportunities for value that can then be delivered via that platform."
1,"We're confident in our ability to win in this segment, and we're investing in next generation technologies to be able to handle what will be even more sophisticated substrates in the near future. Although the market opportunity is still relatively small compared with front-end equipment, it does provide us with a significant opportunity for continued growth in this business, which has already become approximately 10% of our Semiconductor product revenue. Our outlook for this segment is for more steady growth in 2018, and certainly for more design wins with new and existing customers."
1,"We're continuing to invest in Soundtrap to make it easier to use and more powerful so that anyone with talent can produce professional content. Now, our position as the leading listening platform allows us to think about creation tools a little bit differently. For the last 70 years, music has been an audio recording and a square piece of cover art because that's what LPs, CDs and downloads could support."
1,"We're currently conducting a series of pre-clinical animal studies to better understand the characteristics of EggPC cells as part of the OvaPrime treatment, and the impact of our improved EggPC cell yield and purity on efficacy. Findings from these studies will allow us to further optimize the design of our Phase 1b/2a trial to provide meaningful insights regarding the safety in secondary end points of OvaPrime. We plan to provide an update on our development plan and begin enrollment in the second half of 2018."
1,"We're doing a great job growing our app active base with growth rates of around 35% over the last several years, and we're benefiting here from tech adoption trends across our base as well as the demographics of new customers. But we still have a significant opportunity to improve the frequency of visit, to move from transactional to relational in our mobile service provision. We think Ask Amex and Pay It Plan It are examples of the type of content that will help move us in that direction."
1,"We're evaluating options to sunset certain less significant product offerings that are not aligned with our strategic direction, are not meaningful contributors to our profitability. This will allow us to more effectively and efficiently deploy capital to growth areas. Our second initiative is to expand into adjacent markets and related applications."
1,"We're excited to be able to serve more Express customers through this offering, extending the reach of the brand and enhancing the overall customer experience. This initiative represents a significant opportunity for Express to capture additional share, and we will support it with targeted messaging in store and online, as well as advertising and customer engagements in the three target markets. In addition, wear to work continues to be a strength for us."
1,We're focused on advancing our fully-owned pipeline of assets. We believe there is significant opportunity ahead and are confident we have the team and expertise in place to achieve our objective of creating a new class of breakthrough drugs to treat patients with cancer. We also intend to build future value for all of our shareholders.
1,"We're getting bigger and bigger when it comes to digital A&P, programmatic buying. So, that, of course, allows us to be more efficient to target better consumers and in markets which are well advanced in that area, which is mostly, for the time being, Western Europe, the Western European side of our business. We're getting more efficient than some of the resources that we can save."
1,"We're getting results in terms of lower acquisition cost, increasing loyalty by 10% to 30%, and much lower churn. We estimate, and this is an estimate, that this kind of insight into customers will allow us to better service and service with more   more services our customers and more customers and deliver around â‚¬500 million additional revenues over the next few years. We're working on other areas together across the group also with new types of branches, which we think will be much more attractive."
1,"We're going to continue to do that because that differentiates us. It allows us to provide what we believe is the best service in the industry so that we're not going to miss deliveries or not be able to fulfill things because our trucks are   we don't have enough trucks or our trucks are broken down. And it also allows our delivery crews to be efficient, enjoy the equipment they're using."
1,"We're going to meet our commitments and we are meeting our commitments according to our long-range plan. On the other hand, where we see opportunities to advance against our investment roadmaps, we'll also take those opportunities. So there is continued investment that will come, although we said in our long-range plan, the investment will be more front-loaded in that five-year period and will start to be a lesser factor as you go forward."
1,"We're in no rush to deploy it. But if we see a great opportunity, as Bahir said, having that strong liquidity allows us to move quickly and take advantage of those opportunities."
1,"We're investing significantly in Southeast Asia and China ,and that will be a growth engine for us moving forward. Our acquired brands, all represent significant opportunity for growth. Last, but not least, we have some members of our international team present today, and so I'm proud to say that we've built a cadre of very strong leaders and managers that really understand their markets and are driving growth whether they'd be in our subsidiary markets or anywhere where we export our wonderful products."
1,"We're just going to help you have a healthy life. As you drive to improve the customer experience, we once again focused across the value chain and see significant opportunities. So my goal today was just to give you a glimpse inside of us building this new growth capability, followed by a development of a comprehensive strategy, building upon a strong culture of process in our PIMS system supported by our focus on the customer from both and ethnography and digitally to drive a differentiated growth."
1,"We're not the largest hub carrier in Chicago, but we're awfully close and another enormous market where we do well, even though we're not the absolute largest. And the good news is we just worked with the Airport Authority to have five more gates there, which allows us to become even stronger."
1,We're operating in a strong airfreight environment underpinned by global economic growth. With the building blocks we have in place and our strong market position we see opportunities to grow with existing customers and to add new ones. We expect our adjusted net income to grow by a mid-20% level when compared with 2017.
1,"We're pleased with the progress we've made over the past two years. But we are convinced that it's just the beginning of our journey and that we have significant opportunity ahead of us to create value for shareholders, our customers, and our valued employees. We are confident in the path that we've laid out to drive continued improvement in SPX FLOW."
1,"We're proactively shaping our business to stay on the forefront of the trends facing financial technology and most important, to ensure we are the partner of choice for our clients. At our Investor Day in June, we shared a series of strategies that we believe will allow us to create sustained value for our shareholders and contribute to even stronger performance in 2018. We know our success is a result of the cumulative effort, dedication and accomplishment of our nearly 24,000 associates around the world who are Fiserv proud and come to work each day to make a difference for our clients and shareholders."
1,"We're proud of the steady progress we made in 2017, and we're confident in our path ahead. We've got significant opportunity ahead of us to put Twitter in as many people's hands as possible and to make the service more relevant to more people every single day. And now back to Krista for questions."
1,We're raising the bar in this powerful item with a new face-decorating technology called direct inkjet printing or DIJ. This allows us to get nearly photorealistic results while maintaining key price points. Look at that face.
1,"We're running S/4, so HANA is underneath the ERP, HANA's underneath Hybris, HANA's underneath the CRM, like Cloud for Customer CRM that we use. And HANA for us, it allows us to have the entire business, as Bill said, on end-to-end on one database which is really, really unique, right, to be able to go from order to   all the way through to fulfillment and financial analysis and reporting all on the same database. It's been powerful for us and HANA performs really well."
1,"We're seeing a pickup in activity in emerging markets and countries, which are now adopting energy policies focused on renewables. Overall, our global production footprint will allow us to make the necessary adjustments to capitalize in continued growth in solar, as activity in new parts of the world start to accelerate. Next slide, please."
1,"We're still seeing large opportunities through both the Middle East and LATAM. We've adjusted our CapEx number for the year and as you rightly pointed out, it's encouraging because we only put CapEx to work when we see opportunities to book new contracts. And so, we still see a very balanced opportunity."
1,"We're talking about taking them down from 50%, 40% down to around 20%. So this combined with at certain hours of the day very cheap renewables will allow us to decrease our carbon footprint, but at the same time take advantage of our coal plants using basically like large batteries. So when you talk about something like IPL or DPL, these are part of that strategy and that they really complement what we are in terms of the various sources of financing we have and the various growth opportunities."
1,"We're the largest trader of crudes in a number of markets. The scale, flexibility and optionality of this activity allows us to bring down the cost of raw materials for the Shell refineries. Our complex refineries contribute to this optimization making feedstocks and operational decisions with full visibility on the economics and product offtake opportunities."
1,We're the only ones selling what we sell at scale in the country today at our price point and average ticket and average orders. So that allows us to have an opportunity to build a platform that nobody else can.
1,"We're very confident that last year's market dynamics are behind us, and we're expecting more normalized customer order patterns in 2018. We believe there are significant opportunities ahead and are confident in our ability to leverage FirstNet and fiber deep network deployments, expansion within the hyperscale data centers, and our compelling quick turn capabilities. In addition to our executing on our strategy, we will maintain our balanced approach to capital allocation through strategically reinvesting in the business, paying down debt, and returning capital to shareholders."
1,"We're very happy to report that the progress is going very well and by end of this calendar year that we will make the facility functional. This allows us to give out more infrastructure services to our merchants in a very securitized and scalable way. It's a Tier-III opportunity, Tier-III center, which has a certain amount of uptime, which means that the availability as well as virtualization will allow us to scale our platform business on top of this opportunity."
1,We're very pleased with the acquisitions we've made over the last 18 months and the progress that they've made. All of them fit well with the core strategy and mobile assets of the group and present significant opportunities for the future. The significant volume growth of the combined Delivery Club and ZakaZaka and its integration with Mail.
1,"We've acquired and integrated Suzuki-led Distribution business that significantly expands our partnership with an excellent brand, which is well-positioned for future growth. We see significant opportunities for future success with the acquired business, supported by our Ignite focus around our value drivers and our ability to leverage our expanded scale. The outlook for Suzuki in Costa Rica and Panama is very encouraging."
1,"We've actually made some modifications to our dock infrastructure that allow us to be able to move just larger quantities of oil on larger vessels, and we hope to be able to report here pretty soon, but we'll be able to berth the first Suezmax from our facility, which again will demonstrate that we're ahead of the curve here because we did expect that we're going to see these incremental volumes. And again we're doing some other optimization activities that will allow us to be able to more efficiently transfer oil between our various tanks, and then more importantly be able to load those out both from a simultaneous standpoint at a more rapid clip onto these large vessels. So I think we're very well situated in Corpus Christi, and I think frankly there could be some opportunities where we see all the oil that we understand Trafigura has committed to, could provide the need for even incremental infrastructure improvements above and beyond what we've already got on the board."
1,"We've adopted a cloud-first strategy, and we have over a third of our infrastructure environment today running in the cloud and we expect that that will increase. We've also developed an open API architecture and that allows us to securely connect partners with our data and our systems, and it's also starting to transform the way our clients can use their own data. And we're going to hear shortly from Garry and Greg on more about this."
1,"We've also identified working capital improvements we can realize in 2018 in the $20 million to $25 million range. These initiatives are not expected to disrupt the business since the opportunities are primarily outside of store operations, but they will allow us to be much more efficient as an organization. I strongly believe there is a significant amount of opportunity available to improve the profitability of the company."
1,"We've always taken the view that being well-capitalized is a real asset. It gives us the flexibility to look at strategic M&A that allows us to continue to be in a very strong position, owning this space for years and years to come; to also potentially add products that are synergistic with Cologuard, increasing the efficiency of our call point in the primary care segment, adding a call point in the GI segment, and potentially giving us more of human and technical capabilities for our pipeline. And we will continue to be good stewards of this capital as we have in the past and feel great about the terms that we raised this capital on."
1,"We've amassed some of the most experienced engineering talent in the world, and as a result, we sit at the forefront of new opportunities to enable and monetize future mobility. Starting with automated driving, as we look forward, we have a significant opportunity to monetize our system and technology capabilities, providing mobility players with an advanced Level 4, Level 5 system like those who are currently operating in every major region of the world. The development work we're doing with several customers in smart cities will result in more then 150 cars on the road by the end of this year, accumulating almost 2 million miles of experience."
1,"We've been able to leverage our local marketing efficiencies much better in those locations than we have in markets where we're not as penetrated and partly that leans into the focus we discussed about a year ago where we're going to look to increase our franchise mix in those markets where we're perhaps less penetrated, which does a few different things. It allows us to focus on our more penetrative markets and it allows those franchisees who would enter the system a market that gives them the opportunity to put further development in place to allow them to further penetrate those markets as well. So those would be the two primary differences."
1,"We've been working on the improving CapEx through procurement, and so I'd say that it will be a good year, and we expect to be a good year within the parameters we have for the business and we see also in our comps in terms of cash flow. So this will allow us to continue to pursue all the opportunities for growth, for example, as Alejandro mentioned, on selective M&A and carve-outs, and we'll continue to allow the company to execute the dividend policy as well."
1,"We've brought in a bunch of new team members in the product realization group to be able to concentrate on this to ensure that that two-year cadence is delivered and effective in terms of its bottom line performance to the company. This goes across our whole portfolio and provides us an entire portfolio to be able to compete with, again, vertical integration that allows us to take footprint day one and to be able to click on licenses and be able to harvest that vertical integration and bottom line results going forward. So, very excited to be here, much more excited today than I was in June."
1,"We've done a due diligence on positron emission tomography or PET technology. Basically, this technology is an adaptation of medical   nuclear medicine, which allows us to see and isolate the carbon elements inside a rock. We have managed to identify 7."
1,"We've expanded on our ability to market to this audience more profitably and on a recurring basis through messaging channels such as email, SMS and push notifications, as well as addressable media such as Facebook and Google using their customer match tools. This allows us to bypass many costly third-party intermediaries that stand between brands and media owners today, one of Fluent's primary value propositions and how we drive stronger economics within our model for our partners and ourselves. Last, we recently announced plans to launch internationally."
1,"We've got a lot of inventories, but they're not always inventories of things that are moving quickly in the market. I think as the deepwater complex gets fired up, we're going to see some significant opportunities to bring down inventories. The receivables write-down could happen in the quarter around the accounting changes for our revenue accounting in Venezuela and all."
1,"We've got insurance companies, banks, other types of financial institutions, regulators, academics, et cetera. So, we believe that it's a model that allows us to have diversification across different kinds of users between the SNL content and the CapIQ content, which is coming together and other types of data services that we're adding, especially alternative data services, et cetera, that we can provide multiple types of users with good experience as well as the data they need. So, we're not as dependent on any one type of industry."
1,"We've invested alongside some of our venture capital partners some of the leading funds in the world in artificial intelligence businesses that look to automate data entry that we can apply in our own business, tech-enabled brokerages with whom we can test our automatic pricing technology, and companies in emerging categories such as crypto and blockchain in order to stay close to these types of markets and technologies. Our latest investment in a leading cryptocurrency payment processor allows us to potentially partner with the leader in the space, monitor how insurance and cryptocurrency continues to evolve that helps us assess opportunities to engage. This investment does not directly harness the risk of any individual cryptocurrency and has the potential to generate a strong return on invested capital on a standalone basis at the same time."
1,"We've made substantial progress in optimizing, repositioning and integrating miraDry into Sientra, following our acquisition of Miramar Labs in July of 2017. We remain confident that the achievement of our near-term strategic objectives, specifically in relation to treatment protocol improvements, device improvements and global commercial infrastructure investments, will allow us to drive growth in large and underserved markets for the permanent reduction of underarm sweat, odor and hair of all colors. No other treatment can make that claim."
1,"We've more than doubled our CPG business to $900 million over the last three years. I mean, that's awesome, and we see opportunities all the time. I mean, how many brands can talk about, not any comps, but big development and big CPG?"
1,"We've not entered the stick-and-tin segment with the Winnebago-branded Towables. And so, the manufacturing space that we'll be adding allows us to not only grow the current product line but potentially consider expansion into these other segments."
1,"We've paid down over $80 million of the original $425 million Term Loan B since we acquired Exar in May of last year. We continue to generate lot of cash flow, and that allows us to not only delever aggressively, but also continue to invest aggressively in the business, and create meaningful new long-term growth vectors for the business. And as I mentioned before, if you look at the long-term model to the business, we've talked about the CAGR."
1,"We've rolled out delivery subscription offers on all three Power Brands, and we're on track to deliver Global Ship Anywhere by the end of this financial year. And this allows us to broaden our access to international markets. Partnerships remain a key area of focus to give us more routes to market for our Power Brands and we're pleased to announce the new deal with Zalando to Simply Be and Jacamo, which will give us access to more than 22 million active customers across 15 countries."
1,"We've run a detailed process looking at several partners certainly on their cloud capabilities, but also addressing other product and go-to-market opportunities. We hope to announce a partnership soon that will allow us to embark on a multi-year transition to the cloud. And as we reflect on all these themes, whether it be our products, our go-to-market, or our evolving technical platform, we hope that you can see that they all work and ladder into delivering truly great customer experiences all around the globe."
1,"We've said that a majority will go to the bottom line and some proportion will be reinvested in the company, but we've also said that if we reinvest in the company, it better have   that it will be accretive. And so, if we see opportunities to invest a little bit of the money and make the company stronger, we'll do so."
1,"We've seen a shift towards natural, smaller, more, what I'd call, boutique-y brands versus large global brands. As you heard me say inside, we've rapidly adjusted our model that we think, particularly in areas like Baby and Beauty, will allow us to regain what I would say is our competitive edge. But at the same time, we're doing it in a way that doesn't compromise I think the very strong clinical development program that we have in our Consumer group, where we actually have clinical data supporting the claims that we make for brands like Neutrogena, Aveeno and even Baby."
1,"We've yet to land one of these. Everything that we've been able to achieve has been from one onesie-twosies types of sales, but if we were to get one of these guys onboard, I mean, we could start off with a pilot program, have a couple hundred patients and then sit down at the table six months to a year later, talk about the savings that we were able to generate, which we feel confident in as a result of our KPMG study results, and then build out a program where we get reimbursed by the savings and we take it deeper and wider to all of their patient lot. So those are going to be the three main focuses for our growth model here in 2018."
1,"What I would offer on that is as we think about our information platforming, there's a bunch of base elements that go along with it, call that the Source-to-Pay procurement module, call that the financial model, call that the order management modules. We're also doing a digital replatforming, and then we're also endeavoring to build a data hub, which will allow us to put all kinds of additional analytical overlays on top of our merchandising tools and our pricing tools. So this is a complete suite of services we are effectively bringing forward that's going to allow us to enhance our capabilities across all the areas."
1,"What I would say is that we're going to be aggressive about looking for opportunities to do better than what we've advertised in our long-term model. And where we see opportunities, we will pursue it aggressively and make sure we're delivering as much value as possible for shareholders. Given the mix of businesses and the growth profile going forward, we'd like to stay consistent with our 47% gross margin out into the 2020 timeframe."
1,"What I would tell you is that over the last several years, we spent a ton of investment on a bunch of things that no one would ever see, but are critical to our clients, whether it be data security, data architecture, accessibility, things that are really important to our university clients and of course the marketing apparatus or the placement apparatus, both of which have a tremendous amount of tech. And then we spend a lot of time building out things like Central Park, which is sort of SaaS technology that allows us to launch programs more easily and quickly. And so, we did say to the world last year, look we're going to be investing more in the learning tech side."
1,"What I'm learning is Orderpads are the biggest value-add, because we allow the restaurants to be able to see their data. And it most importantly allows us to interact with them. So my focus is you've heard for 2018 is about making sure we develop the right tools."
1,"What is new from the Analyst Day was that the next-generation automation, which is actually a significant step change and really changes our entire operating model and makes it much more efficient for us as well, has now been   we've now received that award and will be going to what's called TRL Level 4 and 5 as a result of that very soon. That now allows us to take that complete package including the access now to the flexible jumpers to be able to move towards our vision as we demonstrated at the Analyst Day."
1,"What we're working toward is now better data analytics in terms of usage of the system. So because you have interactive, doesn't necessarily bring different characteristics, but it does bring us the insight to see how you use your system and maybe you're once on in the morning, once on at night, maybe you're once on in the weekend, maybe you're on and off all throughout the day, but it will allow us to see changes in those patterns. And we're hopeful that our ability to analyze those changes in patterns is going to allow us to be more proactive with customers to make sure that, hey, you're still getting the benefit that you thought you would get on day one when you purchased it, and how do we use that with our insights, but that's in the early stages in terms of anything we're doing at this point."
1,"What you're seeing on the screen is a couple of examples. The palletizer and the auto sleever on the Presort side, allow us to be more efficient in those operations and then you saw just a second ago, the auto store fulfillment capability that we are launching this year in Newgistics, which will allow us to dramatically increase the accuracy of our fulfillment operation and allow us to fulfill a lot more capacity in a single building. We're excited about the opportunities here."
1,"What's important to remember again is they were resellers of our technology. This allows us to quickly and effectively integrate them into our business, realize very meaningful revenue and EBITDA improvements. This strategy enables us to augment our already solid organic growth and these individual sales people who are ahead of banner year, this acquisition strategy is just as important to bring on new customers and become a very efficient scalable company."
1,"What's more? Our new facility allows us to expand to up to 155,000 square feet in the future, which would enable us to operate at 10 times our initial capacity. This is critical to maintaining Goodfood's leading market position and will enable us to support our continued growth with the capacity to serve more than an estimated 200,000 subscribers from our Montreal facility and to generate more than CAD 200 million in revenue."
1,"When completed, which is expected in the second quarter of this year, these units will be among some of the nicest assisted living units in the Dallas market. After the conversion is complete, we plan to create a memory care unit within this community that will allow us to care for some of our existing residents as opposed to them leaving us for a higher level of care. We continue to move forward on our other expansion projects to take advantage of opportunities in certain markets and find growth internally."
1,"When it comes to step-up in marketing, I mean, there will be a step-up in marketing because of the World Cup. I mean, I think what we'll do   our planning is to spend as appropriate and where we see opportunities to spend and where we can get returns, we will do. So I'm not going to land on a number."
1,"When many of our competitors are out attempting to contract for nurse practitioners and physicians on a part-time basis, we have full-time employed physicians and nurse practitioners in our centers. In addition, our scale allows us to invest in clinical innovation. You can see we have 226 clinical specialty units from the most high-end, our new PowerBack model, which is virtually like an inpatient rehab hospital has that level of capability, but still operating at a skilled nursing cost platform."
1,"When we look at the market, we believe there's an opportunity for the new Kemper to become the industry leader. The increased scale and focus will allow us to offer a valuable service to niche segments. It will also give us the ability to spread fixed costs across our business and will differentiate us from other smaller nonstandard auto writers, who may not be able to justify incremental investments in product, pricing and claim capabilities."
1,"When you look at a sock that sells for five six bucks a dozen and I can tell you don't make a lot of money on them in terms of the whole overall SG&A associated. So making less socks and moving upstream is probably the way we're looking at the business as we go as we go forward, but in other areas where we see opportunity and turning to the active side, I mean that's really in our sweet spot because there you're selling at a much   even the basic products were sold at a much higher price point. So, that's an area where we really see an opportunity if as we go forward."
1,"When you look at DevCo 1 and you look at peers in DevCo 1, primary peer has their own MLP. So there will be some one-off opportunities in DevCo 1, but when you get out into CPA or Wadestown as we've discussed, you've got other operators that have undedicated acreage that really that's where the significant opportunities will be."
1,"When you take a look at the additional opportunity set that we're going to be able to service, you can easily triple that addressable market. Now, we're not ready yet to publicly say exactly what size we think that market is, but it is a knowable number and it allows us to diversify into places like the civilian space. We've talked about the FAA as an example."
1,"When you think about all the exciting things going on for us as we step into 2018, the sales partners we just talked about that are onboard, the number of products that we talked about in the prepared remarks, and then this Brainlab relationship< all of those have been factored into how we think about guidance for the year. But what I will say about Brainlab is that, having this partnership now allows us to compete in a new way in the market. So, as we're looking at different contracts at hospitals or buying systems that are looking to have navigation and imaging as part of that, we feel like we have really a state-of-the-art partner with Brainlab."
1,"When you're designing twice as many stopes, there's a lot more engineering involved, but they're sort of rounding errors almost in terms of head count for that operation. One of the slides in the pack does try to give some insight into the focus that we have been putting on to our cost base going forward, and there's still some significant opportunities, some of which we're realizing at the moment around things like cost base   energy costs, use of sort of underutilized infrastructure, downstream. A lot of other things that we're working on to   and TCRCs as well to address that cost base as   to align with the production guidance going forward."
1,"Where we go from there looking beyond 2018 will remain a factor of what it is that the business looks like and the growth. JJ did outline some pretty significant opportunities, and we did that vote back in June at our Investor Day, as well as in his update. So we feel the opportunity is there."
1,"Whether we're able to execute that or not, we'll work every day to try to do that. So, the answer to your question is partially in improved efficiency from the packing house, but also from doing more specialty packing that allows us to get up-charges to our customers, expanding our margins in total for both our fruit and the outside growers' fruit that we handle. So, those two pieces are what   are driving much of this change, but probably the biggest piece that's driving the improvement in the profitability is the forecasted improvement in our orange operations."
1,"While it's very early, we've seen great traction in both new solutions within our ShippingEasy customer base. We charge additional service fees for the solutions, so this allows us to further increase our customer lifetime values and to leverage the investment we have already made in sales and marketing to acquire that customer. We also believe that customers that adopt these solutions derive greater value from our solutions overall and this results in greater customer stickiness and thus lower churn."
1,"While not yet complete, we believe that we can achieve a safety integrity level or a sale certification on our product development process in the first half of the 2018. After speaking with customers and investigating opportunities, we believe this upgrade in certification will allow us to quote on larger projects with our products and explore other market possibilities. In addition to the expanded certification, our R&D team is working to improve the capabilities of our 3,100 BMS."
1,"While our actions and investments in go-to-market are not done, we have made significant progress and believe we are on the right track to continue to drive growth and improve execution worldwide. We are in a multi-year transformation and actions last year centered around building the foundation to enable the company to capitalize on significant opportunity ahead of us. We focused on building the infrastructure, processes, analytics and organizational structure necessary to take the company forward."
1,"While our discussions on this call focus primarily on the information   implementation of a few larger projects such as Michigan/Ohio Pipeline, our teams also continue to focus on the singles and doubles that have continued to add value to our core business. Looking forward to 2018, we anticipate an overall improvement in business condition in the segment and we'll continue to pursue organic growth projects and accretive acquisitions that will allow us to meet evolving customer demands. And now, I'll turn the call over to Keith for additional discussion on our financial results."
1,"While quickly expanding our coverage from 0 to over $1 billion in annualized gross food sales, we also achieved our goal of exiting the year at similar economics on orders that restaurants deliver for themselves and orders that GrubHub delivers on their behalf. This is important because it allows us to offer the best restaurants to every diner while maximizing profitability. Sales and marketing expenses were $45."
1,"While sales data for our tiered solutions is still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales in our Tier 3 and 4 categories, encompassing our holistic integrated solutions, were up almost 10% this quarter and represent approximately 15% of our total sales. We continue to expand our building management and lighting control platforms, which allows us to provide and enhance our comprehensive set of Atrius-enabled IoT business solutions built on our unique capability to collect extensive and valuable sensory data through intelligent luminaires, lighting and building management controls, software platform services and development tools. These solutions deliver connectivity and intelligence to a space via an expansive network of smart LED lighting and controls, and a software platform that gathers, unlocks and transforms raw data to enable a broad range of software solutions, addressing critical business challenges, all while delivering a superior visual environment and significant energy savings."
1,"While Turkey Track is only six sections, OXY has significant acreage in this region of Northern New Mexico Delaware Basin. This modular development approach allows us to leverage scale across multiple smaller development positions. Innovative facilities design and development sequencing allows us to reduce costs for operations across several sections while using regional subsurface characterization and operating efficiencies to leverage our basin-wide scale advantages."
1,"While we are still targeting an efficiency ratio in the mid-40s longer term, we are budgeting for our efficiency ratio this year to be in the range of 46% to 48%. In summary, while we are taking a cautious   cautiously optimistic stance, we are making significant enhancements to our overall enterprise risk infrastructure, and the tax reform creates potentially significant opportunity for our organization to enhance returns. Overall, we believe Bank of Hope is well-positioned to further increase the value of our franchise and deliver even more to our shareholders, customers, employees in 2018 and beyond."
1,"While we consider our operations very efficient, we simply do not have the size and scale of some of our competitors. We do feel there are some good international opportunities and are looking at alternatives which will allow us to be competitive in those markets. With respect to the Pristiq and Lamictal ANDAs, they are still active and we are continuing to do what we can to move the process along."
1,"While we continue to innovate around our core strengths such as with our recently announced next-gen payroll and tax platforms, you will also recall that in October we announced our acquisition of Global Cash Card, which further strengthened our payroll offering with the expansion of digital accounts and flexible payment offerings. This was an exciting acquisition that allows us to further support the evolving needs of our clients and we are very pleased with the level of client interest in their digital payment services. With this acquisition, ADP became the only HCM provider with a proprietary digital payments processing platform, thus enabling the opportunity for greater operational efficiency and a seamless client experience."
1,"While we do not expect to immediately use this authorization, we believe this provides another option to maximize long-term shareholder value as we execute on disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. To conclude, our acquisition of Tembec is a transformational event that will provide a significant opportunity to grow the earnings power and cash flow of the company. Thank you again, for your time this morning."
1,"While we expect our effective tax rate to increase modestly, the ability to efficiently access our global cash is meaningful. This will allow us to create a much more effective capital structure as we move forward. I will now turn the call over to Steve for additional insight into the performance of our market sectors and operations."
1,"While we have the potential for $400 today using our existing services, our customers today are using about $145. So, there is a really significant opportunity for us to grow revenue without even adding more market share, just by increasing the functionality that our existing customers are using. And so, there's a lot of low hanging fruit there that we can go after."
1,"While we made significant progress toward improving our revenue trajectory over the last year, we continue to experience revenue declines. The combination with Fuji Xerox will allow us to accelerate our growth by providing access to key growth markets, unlocking synergy opportunities and leveraging each other's competitive advantages. We're starting from a base of $18."
1,"Why London is the largest market in the world is, because London market you could be a broker sitting in Dubai, you could be sitting in Europe, you could be sitting in Asia, you could be anywhere, and you're part of the London market, and you are riding, you are subscribing to a policy, you're taking 5% of a policy, 10% of a policy, negotiating it with somebody, all those opportunities because as they mandated all of them will also has to use us. What that does is, it also allows us that opportunity, that now we have brokers within Europe, within Asia who will be kind of forced to use this, and as they start using it, first it will increase our transaction count, because part of it is that technically is outside the scope of our transaction count, as also what will also happen is that it also allows us to say in those markets as we launch our other exchanges outside PPL, whether it is in the markets like Singapore or Bermuda or U. S."
1,"Why? Because we have a significant opportunity ahead of us. As you see reflected in our excellent results, we are on a strong path and we have made tremendous progress in building scale and operational strength."
1,"With 186 horizontal Wolfcamp wells online at year-end, we continued to demonstrate the resilience of our asset, its suitability for manufacturing-style development and proficiency of our team. The history we have with our asset base gives us a robust understanding of how to extract by   looking forward, we see opportunities to continue consolidating southern Midland Basin assets, reporting our existing infrastructures and deploying our industry leading execution and cost structure to create additional value for our shareholders. With that, that concludes this."
1,"With a 100% ownership, we now have full control to develop this business how we think best in the future. We continue to expect operating margins of more than 20% by 2020 in 2015 exchange rate terms, but we see opportunity for further margin enhancement beyond that. Brian will talk you through some of the drivers in more detail in a moment, but we expect to see operating margins for the Consumer Healthcare business approaching the mid-20s percentages by 2022 at 2017 exchange rates."
1,"With a new cycle in front of us, Alexandre will be focused on building out a skilled team, implementing further process, controls and executing our mid and long-term strategies along with the rest of our team. Alexandre joins Gabriela Garcia and AndrÃ© Shinohara who I introduced on calls in the last few quarters, to round out the leadership team that changes with enhancing our operations, gaining share and strengthening the pillars of the company, that will allow us to achieve long-term sustainable growth. It's clear to us where we have to invest our focus and energy to drive improvements in our business."
1,"With approximately 35,000 business and 100,000 consumer subscribers, Mozy presents a truly unique opportunity to accelerate our cross-sell efforts. In addition, the scale of our cloud-based data protection platform allows us to drive an incredible amount of synergies from this deal, making it accretive to earnings. As Mohamad noted, we expect the transaction to close late in the first quarter of 2018."
1,"With Dealer Inspire suite of solutions, we are expanding into new channels, including an award-winning website platform, messaging platform with artificial intelligence, real-time online car buying and dynamic inventory advertising. Dealer Inspire's technologies will allow us to strengthen our attribution capabilities and further integrate and demonstrate our value to dealers. I'd like to now turn over the call to Becky to go over the financial details on the acquisition, our preliminary 2017 results as well as our 2018 outlook."
1,"With Dealer Inspire's suite of solution, we are expanding into new channels, including an award winning website platform, messaging platform with artificial intelligence, real-time online car buying and dynamic advertising inventory. Dealer Inspire's technologies will allow us to strengthen our attribution capability and further integrate and demonstrate our value to dealers. We have already started the integration of their proprietary messaging system, Conversations, and their digital retailing solution, Online Shopper, into our platform."
1,"With delivered investments in labor, inventory and marketing, we will accelerate new customer acquisition and drive greater wallet share among the 25 million existing members in DSW's Rewards base. Importantly, we expect these investments will allow us to not only drive sales growth in 2018, but provide us with a platform to deliver sustained revenue growth well into the future. Let me turn the floor over to Roger, who will provide more details about 2018 guidance."
1,"With each passing day, we identify ways to bring even more value to our channel partners through greater use of automation in digital marketplaces. Our global footprint also allows us to explore new ways to optimize our operations. We have best practices in each region and we can now share those best practices in more countries around the world, all in an effort to enhance our efficient, variable, low-cost route to market for our vendor partners."
1,"With our longstanding stature as an industry leader in the active adult segment as well as our strong reputation in the entry-level and move-up segments in each of our markets, we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of the attractive opportunities in each of these buyer cohorts. Also new for us in 2018 is the establishment of AVH Mortgage, a 50-50 joint venture with loanDepot, a leading retail mortgage lender, which will allow us to better serve our homebuyers by providing an expansive range of products through state-of-the-art technology to allow more seamless mortgage process. Operationally, AVH Mortgage will give us better visibility and a greater ability to manage our backlog and closing rates."
1,"With our new carpet tile and broadloom collections, our commercial sales are strengthening in most channels with particular growth in hospitality, institutional, retail, and Mainstreet. The enhanced segmentation of our commercial sales organization by channel allows us to better leverage our soft and hard surface portfolios to provide comprehensive project solutions. Sales of our award-winning Lichen Collection are accelerating as customers embrace its leading design and unique sustainability story."
1,"With our recent commercial and private banking hires in Boston, we're in a strong position to capitalize on those opportunities. It's a strong culture and it's the right people that have allowed us to come this far, and we believe it will allow us to keep delivering on our promises. This momentum should produce strong results over the next several years and that will benefit all our constituents."
1,"With proof of concept validation complete, our efforts in 2018 will be to prioritize B-TRAN's development and accelerate its path to commercialization for the multibillion-dollar power semiconductor market. This allows us to use our resources most effectively and aggressively manage our cash use. We're looking forward to seeing our B-TRAN technology leverage our results to date and take the next steps in commercialization."
1,"With regard to cloud, our IT modernization initiatives are relentlessly focused on cloud technology. Cloud technology offers significant advantages for business agility and cost, things like the ability to tap into elastic capacity, which allows us to provide compute capacity that grows with our peak seasons and our peak times and cloud environments, improved security, improved performance and scalability due to the modernization of these applications, really terrific capabilities. And equally as important, the proximity that cloud computing environments provide to our customers and our operations around the world."
1,"With regard to the hardware business, certainly, the strength in the fourth quarter could conceivably create some difficult comps in fourth quarter next year. But again, when we look at our pipeline of opportunities in 2018 for the hardware business, there are some sizable and significant opportunities, certainly seven-figure-plus type deals that are in the pipeline. So, I would not   I certainly   over time, as we've said, I think many times, we expect the hardware business to be on a slow decline."
1,"With regard to Unidine, it's a great acquisition for us, a very good business, well positioned in senior living. It brings with it a good geographic footprint in the sector, a good management team, and it allows us to consolidate our senior living sector and start to think about how we play our brands into that sector across the country."
1,"With sales exceeding $1. 3 billion for the first time, all three of our core businesses are contributing to the success of our portfolio, which allows us to balance our investment opportunities and priorities. Fuel Specialties maintained its solid performance and excellent cash flow."
1,"With synergies, we expect the acquisition to be highly accretive coming in under 6 times EBITDA. We see significant opportunities in the market to drive other highly accretive acquisitions, capitalizing on our strong balance sheet. These are just a few of the meaningful moves we have made to capitalize on our outstanding platforms and position the company for meaningful revenue acceleration and value creation and compete more effectively with other media for a larger share of ad dollars."
1,"With the addition of T&C and our expanded network of daycare center partners in the Bay Area, we have significantly enhanced the care solutions available to our corporate clients and their employees in this key market. This acquisition allows us to continue to scale as the demand for our backup care services continues to grow. Our short-term approach is to continue to partner with the top agencies across the country to deliver exceptional service to our corporate clients while also assessing longer-term growth opportunities in a few key strategic target markets to grow our Care@Work business."
1,"With the broad label we received, Auryxia provides a new first line treatment option for iron deficiency anemia across the full range of adult CKD patients not on dialysis. We believe this provides a significant opportunity for physicians to treat their patients at an earlier stage of the disease before their anemia becomes more severe. Our results from the fourth quarter are primarily from the growth that we continue to drive in the hyperphosphatemia market."
1,"With the majority of our ad dollars spent on digital channels and six years of data on customer behavior under the Wayfair brand, we are able to measure payback on an extremely granular basis. Our proprietary ad tech stack that we brought in-house over the last four years is also a competitive advantage that allows us to leverage internal and external data to target customers efficiently. The ongoing improvement in the performance of our site has resulted in more and more opportunities for us to invest ad dollars, while staying within the same overall payback period on a contribution margin basis."
1,"With the restructuring transactions and covenant compliance challenges behind us, we're able to move forward in 2018 a stronger, better capitalized Genesis. The success and impact of these transactions gives us enhanced financial flexibility and allows us to apply greater focus on our core operating objectives and opportunities. With that, Aileen, please open the line for questions."
1,"With these economics, we can and should continue to invest into customer experience and growth. It allows us to add even more energy back into an already effective premium flywheel. And naturally, we do this by investing in marketing to acquire even more users."
1,"With these investments, we've been able to support our customers' growth and gain share. We'll continue to invest in new capacity as long as we see opportunities to grow and generate strong returns. We will also complement these investments by seeking acquisitions in regions where we may have an ability to accelerate our growth."
1,"With this acquisition, we will expand beyond our core listings business to reach those dealers who are spending on first-party marketing such as their own websites, social media and other performance marketing channels. Expanding into these categories will allow us to take advantage of the tailwinds across the entire digital auto category. This acquisition directly aligns with our strategy to enable our partners by connecting them to the in-market audience and intelligence they need to increase turn and gain market share."
1,"With this most recent expansion, we will serve a population of over 7 million in the mid-Atlantic region. The expansion allows us to build networks that will improve coverage between our existing service areas and Sprint's metro networks, providing a better experience and more reliable service for our customers as well as introducing significant opportunities for our continued growth. For the year, slide 5 shows the income statement increases, reflecting the benefit from a full-year's results from the acquired nTelos markets."
1,"With this transaction, obviously, the most important fact is that we partnered with world class institutional investors. And we do anticipate launching both DEXYCU and Durasert in the first half of 2019 and assuming a positive outcome on the shareholder vote approving the transaction and, of course, Essex exercising its warrant, the proceeds from the announced financing and our cash on hand will allow us to fund the launch of DEXYCU and pending favorable regulatory review potentially launch Durasert."
1,"WoodSpring is a great example of that, where we bring a fantastic growing brand onto our platform. That fits nicely into that segment, and really allows us to bring the distribution power that we bring, the marketing reservations activity, the technology to these owners and help them improve both their same-store sales and their return on investment. So, we do have a   if you look at the 12 brands that we have, there's an interesting mix there of brands we've grown organically and brands we've acquired over the years."
1,"Yeah, I seem to recall something about the   sort of the razor blades could be as much as 10x with the razor cost over time. It's a significant opportunity."
1,"Yeah, it definitely allows us to continue pursuit of those accretive investments that we're after, as well as the return of capital strategy that we think is appropriate and helpful to shareholder returns on a long-term basis."
1,"Yeah, that's correct. The challenge and the underlying thesis of the acquisition is that that we will be able to expand the presence of OEP from what has been northeast centric more to nationwide in the market areas, where we have a clear value proposition that will allow us to grow."
1,"Yeah, the capacity is actually in all three DevCos. There is a significant opportunity in all three we think to add to third-party volumes. So if you want to kind of step through each of them on the water capacity side and Beartooth both fresh water and produced water, large system we think we can incrementally add relatively cheaply third-party growth on that system in Bighorn both in the FERC regulated pipeline as well as in the gas plants."
1,"Yeah, well, I always like to look at these things from an opportunity standpoint, because we need to follow our customers. And when we see opportunities to deliver products a different way to respond to the ultimate customers' desires more, we need to be on that forefront. And so, for us, this is   I would call it more of a journey."
1,"Yeah. And that actually is one of the benefits of bringing these two drugs together, because it allows us to accelerate our plan outside of our initial markets with the strengths of both of these drugs. We had always planned with volanesorsen to expand out of our initial markets in Europe, look at some JPAC, Latin America and with inotersen with both drugs this really allows us to accelerate, how we think about expanding in some additional markets."
1,"Yeah. And, Collyn, I would just say from the top of the house, we made a commitment, obviously, to continue to aggressively grow HAS, so where we see opportunity, we're not going to limit ourselves by not investing. We're excited that we're seeing great PPNR growth and some operating leverage in the business, but we'll continue to invest where we see opportunity to capture more share and strengthen the business overall."
1,"Yeah. But it's not either or, I think we see opportunities in both parts. I think there is a little bit of a trend that high potent, of course, are also more attractive to us, because this is our expertise, which we can make also the difference."
1,"Yeah. But, Joe, to do it on a more scalable basis and more economically, I think we do have to make some changes in our supply chain, and the first of which is expansion of our Conklin, New York facility, which will allow us to service all of the Northeast within a day pretty cost effectively. So that will come live in 2019."
1,"Yeah. Certainly, we continue to look at opportunities particularly in our Technical Services business where we see opportunities to drive more waste into our network of disposal locations, and so that's one particular area. I think the other thing which has really been   we've really been excited about is the success of Safety-Kleen."
1,"Yeah. I think specific to the question on margin improvement, I think we see opportunities both for gross margin improvement and ultimately driving operating leverage in the business. I think, on the gross margin side, it's really the dynamics that we've referenced in our prepared remarks."
1,"Yeah. I think there's significant opportunity and it's definitely been our philosophical approach is where we can serve our customers directly, as we want to; and nobody is going to train our users better; nobody is going to provide better product level support. So where we can, we will be direct and we've done that in Canada where we transitioned from a distributor to direct."
1,"Yeah. Look at prior to the whole rationale for why we've gone pediatric first and then seek to expand to adults is that this allows us to establish a beachhead. This quality of data, and this strength of data, I think is unparalleled in this community, and I think if we're successful, given the unmet nature of the disease, we establish a new paradigm."
1,"Yeah. So we have spoke of I think the fact that we have a strong balance sheet, and obviously that allows us to think about strategic opportunities to grow our business. And obviously we're very pleased to have announced the expansion of auto in both Europe and in the U."
1,"Yeah. So, like I said, showing multi-lineage myelopreservation without compromising chemo efficacy is the opportunity where we're really assessing and we believe this is a significant opportunity and unmet need."
1,"Yeah. We feel confident that we'll get nice growth as we said in 2018 and then remember in 2019, we got additional capacity coming online. In 2020, we got additional capacity, and in 2021 additional capacity."
1,"Yeah. Well, first of all, I think, on the second part of that question, I think there's opportunities, or I know Kevin may want to talk about this a bit more here with you now or later, but, yeah, certainly we think a big part of what we're doing down the South is, in terms of where we've been trying to locate our mills, a good consideration has been to be close to tidewater, because we do believe there's a significant opportunity. In the past, what we found is in the U."
1,Yeah. We're   it's still an issue that we're looking at and then we see opportunities out in the market. We remain focused on some of the deeper metro areas obviously where we think there's opportunity to continue to build scale profitably.
1,"Yeah. Yes, I think at this stage, we see opportunities around the Med area for that rig potentially to work on. We also have a replacement strategy to upgrade it with another rig if we don't find the new contracts for it."
1,"Year-to-date volumes are up, well within our guidance range and versus a strong volume quarter in Q1 of 2017. Now, however, regardless of market conditions, there are several factors entirely within our control that will allow us to drive sales growth and improve profitability in 2018. As I mentioned, since separating from the Flooring business, we have been strategically investing in new products, sales and support services and advanced manufacturing capabilities."
1,"Yes, it's a tough question. In most of our business units, there's not direct competitive data that will allow us to gauge in any kind of real time what our market share gains or losses might have been. Generally, if you look at our overall organic growth performance over the course of the last few years, I think, we compare pretty favorably to other industrial equipment manufacturers."
1,"Yes, no, we see opportunity. Definitely, Eden, last year was much more focused on restructuring, putting the management team in the place we wanted to put them in."
1,"Yes, over the last probably 5 years or 10 years, we have had solutions like this before. What we're looking at more in the future is how do we enable additional insight, and the fact that now our products are really enabled for connectivity allows us to do a little bit more certainly as cloud computing is becoming a lot more prevalent in a lot of these areas. So, we see it as a   just as a nice opportunity for us."
1,"Yes. And within that frame, we see opportunity and opportunity is here today and then there's underlying trends and things that will drive even greater opportunities and move ahead. So, we have really taken advantage of those three different businesses and capabilities that we have, bring them together with a very customer market focused leadership and just like we do in automotive OEM, just like we do in electronics and really looking at that frame around automotive electrification."
1,"Yes. So, I mean, the first thing, the vessel that we're activating is in Naga, it's a lift barge that we mobilize from Africa to Middle East because we see opportunities there and she already has worked there. So that's good news."
1,"Yet to sustain the strong performance in the current casual dining environment, we need to introduce the type of change that is necessary to make our business truly successful. We are making and will continue to make the important choices around business investments and we will need to innovate in a way that allows us to fully capitalize on the differentiated position that Red Robin holds with the restaurant consumer. These actions support our intention to first return to absolute and consistent earnings growth, and then put ourselves into a position to allow us to provide growth and returns that one associates with high performing organizations."
1,"You can almost never get enough of that, right? So, I think that allows us to play very effectively against some of the other firms that you talked about. Some of the pure play offshore firms, for example, haven't frankly built out those consulting capabilities over the last several years."
1,"You can take a look at the computational capability now we have in Tensor Core, compare that to a non-optimized GPU or even a CPU, it's now two-plus orders of magnitude greater computational throughput. And that allows us to do things like synthesize images in real time, synthesize virtual worlds, animate characters, animate faces, bring a new level of virtual reality and artificial intelligence to these video games."
1,"You could argue that, as you said, some of the other ones that are related to ThreatMetrix that you could argue that it's easier to establish a local presence but there are lots of local regulations, lots of local restrictions on what you can do that you have to work your way through one location at a time. But we think there's significant opportunity in these in the U. S."
1,"You have to put the capital in the ground, sign an initial contract and then wait to lease it up over time to clear cost of capital. It's just a different way, it's a different business and we think all of them are really good and extremely positive for us, because it allows us to get the right revenue across the right assets. And it allows us to generate long-term returns that are well in excess of our cost of capital, which is the core of what I think my job is, is to make sure that happens, invest money to make money over your cost of capital, that we are   we are positioning ourselves to do over the time with the small cell and fiber business and we're allowing ourselves to continue on the tower business."
1,You made the reference with the Schoeller Allibert acquisition of potentially some partnering with families in Germany and the rest of Europe. Just wondering how significant opportunity that might be.
1,"You mentioned acquisitions, and Lotte could be a natural acquisition target for the OpCo entity to create a same kind of tolling mechanic around that production as it has around the existing three crackers, and of course, bottlenecking opportunities. So we see significant opportunity with those four levers to continue to grow so long as there is a fair return in valuation to make that happen. We certainly see -you mentioned the Lotte asset, we certainly see that as a very interesting and potentially attractive opportunity for OpCo in the future once that plant is completed."
1,"You need a solution that's able to track at high speed, able to manage SKU complexity and doesn't require a direct line of sight. And we think RFID has a lot of room to continue growing from that perspective into the future and we feel confident in our ability to continue delivering that as well."
1,"You recall they're very large, private-pay dental market and the very, very significant fragmentation today in the market. So, we see significant opportunities as we progress to acquire alongside the number of greenfield startups as well and that will continue. We're also looking at some assets in both the clinical and diagnostic side in Poland."
1,"You'd start a station and guess what; you'd be listening to something other than Kendrick Lamar. So Premium Access allows us to fix a lot of those things, it allows us to have that much more direct relationship between the listener, the song, the artist and drive a lot of benefits on both the advertising and subscription side. So we're super excited about it, just rolled out in December."
1,"You'll see on the schedule that on page 4 that we have the $64,000   $64 million balloon which is due this year which we're currently in the process of refinancing and working through the refinancing on that, and we're confident that we'll have that refinance before the maturity in August. So with the $155 million of liquidity that we currently have, plus the cash flow from operations which you've mentioned, the refinancing of that $64 million facility and a few other options that we have for raising liquidity that Kevin has mentioned, we feel confident on our liquidity position through 2018 at the levels you had mentioned."
1,"You've got 130 million people and less than 10% have a passport. So if you look at those fundamentals of what's really going to drive traffic near term and long term, we think there's significant opportunity. If you look over the next 20 years, about 7,200 aircraft are going to be required there."
1,You've opened or are opening VR centers. I mean what have you learned so far over the past 12 months as it relates to VR and do you continue to view that as a significant opportunity for IMAX?
1,"Yvonne will go into the economic details in just a moment, but I'd like to first provide some context. For Alnylam, the restructured agreement allows us to create a global company that increases our strategic options and offers a number of key advantages. First, it simplifies and streamlines development, commercial, and alliance operations, and provides both parties with the flexibility and agility needed to make innovative medicines available to patients as quickly as possible."
1,"ZBB, zero based budgeting, has equipped us to clearly identify where we are positioned relative to our cost benchmarks. And that allows us to make really sharp choices about where to invest to drive our growth model for the long-term. For example, with ZBB, we targeted substantial cost reductions for communication asset creation, but we continue to build our brand equities with increased media investment, in effect showing fewer, better assets to more consumers for longer."
0,"""Clearly Q1 reflected a softening price environment driven by continued uncertainty regarding trade, moderating global growth, and regulatory disruptions. As a result, we took action to identify an additional $25 million of productivity improvement measures which are on top of the previously identified $10 million we announced last quarter. We expect approximately two thirds of the benefits from these measures to be realized in fiscal '19 with the remaining one third in fiscal '20."""

0,"2017 was a year where we, again, saw fantastic support from our banks, bond investors, and shareholders. We kick off 2017 with a really robust balance sheet and strong cash flow generation that allows us to increase the dividend level.

So it allows us to create cross-sell and bundle even more capabilities in with people who are issuing cards or accepting payments or need to transition to a digital era, where we can bring the security and capabilities that quite frankly might not be served in the marketplace, so processing is another strong growth area for us.

And I'm still comfortable and confident that the first step of the margin improvement will come in 2018 and we're going to push with all those measures plus the market evolutions to the 18% margin for 2020."

The strength of our balance sheet will allow us to take advantage of opportunities that arise as the cycle turns more positive. Now, Tom will discuss some of the early signs we're seeing that seem to indicate that this may be starting to happen."
0,"44) that we talked about, bang, off it goes and we've had fantastic success in India and delivered a lot of new builds this year. So, I mean it sounds a little arrogant when you say we see opportunity everywhere in the world, but we actually do and where we get ourselves in trouble it's generally because we haven't done the right thing by the customer. We are very lucky we have this incredible brand that's taste-driven, and when we operate and executed well, we generate demand."

So, the way we have packaged the entire product and the ticket size put together we're able to charge a little bit of a premium for this provident product that we've launched."
0,"46) I mean we have, I think, had a very consistent evolution in our risk appetite and in our risk tools and in our credit models, more recently now, especially for retail. So I would, I mean, I think this allows us to expect a lower cost of credit than the average before."
0,"47) throw up all the cash, and we are currently advocating a lot of franking credits to 50% payout ratio. So this new dividend policy on the back of the strength from our balance sheet allows us to just smooth out that profile to provide greater payout through that whole investment cycle. So those are the three aspects of the announcement today."

And so we are in the midst of modeling right now anyone who calls and mentions interest rate change, consolidation, getting a different loan, and it's an interesting analytic piece which will allow us to target individual at risk customers from the standpoint of consolidation in such a way that we don't put our NIMs, the entire portfolio at risk by responding with a meat cleaver when its capital is called for."

0,"5 million shares. While we anticipate that it will take the banks working on our behalf between two to three quarters to execute the buyback, the accounting treatment allows us to reduce our share count by approximately 8 million shares or approximately 70% of the ASR immediately upon entering into the agreement. Once the repurchase is technically completed, the share count would be further reduced by the number of shares actually repurchased, excluding the number of shares reflected in the initial reduction."
0,5 million. For 2018 we are planning to spend $24 million which will allow us to fund our digital initiatives as well as a full television flight in both spring and fall. We are also looking very carefully at our SG&A cost infrastructure and working to tighten up every area of the SG&A cost base.

0,"5% level we need to prudently operate the firm. Not only do we remain committed to returning at least $60 billion of capital during the current and next two CCAR cycles, obviously subject to regulatory approval, but we feel confident about our ability to generate capital going forward. If anything, that ability has been enhanced by tax reform."
0,"5%. But with the momentum we have coming out of the fourth quarter, and the volumes that we're seeing, and the ability that we're talking to our customers and have a fairly good outlook, we feel confident that we're going to go over the top of that in our first quarter. And that's why we're talking mid to high single-digits, and we fully expect stores to be in the high-end of that range."
0,"5%. Our goal continues to be to drive profitable customer count growth, and we believe our 2018 plan will allow us to achieve that goal. New restaurant development remains a focal point for our system, and we are proud that we were able to accelerate in 2017 by growing our global footprint by 1."
0,"5%. When we look at, as I said, demographics, we look at economic, we look at our capital policy, we look at our operational and strategic initiatives, we feel confident at this point in our 2% to 3% number."
0,"5%. With continued focus on inventory management, we've been able to lower the amount of pieces that we need to take to mark down or tied to sale, which in turn allows us to sell more item to full price, building on our margin, and top line sales performance. It's also worth noting that on a constant currency basis, our stock prices is a gross margin would have been 79."

0,"57) thrombosis or changes in hemodynamics of the patient that will allow us to basically get better outcomes, because we catch early issues that otherwise wouldn't have been caught and avoid hospitalizations, which typically occur back at the center that did the original implant. So, they're very inconvenient for the accounts, which we want doing more   the normal procedures versus monitoring these patients."
0,"58), so first of all in the implementation, definitely, I want to echo what Udi said with regards to skill set, and we identified that a few quarters ago, and we are focusing on enabling and training, and we have new programs that we're actually introducing this year. We're very excited with Version 10 that was introduced end of last year because it allows us to implement faster and secure our customer faster as you saw. It's part of everything that we do."

0,"5B was roughly 63% in the target window and has performed below the type curve. We believe this underperformance is directly attributable to drilling outside of the target window, and 3D across the entire acreage position will allow us to plan wells achieve maximum percentage of lateral and the optimal targets can significantly impact well performance in the future. Turning into slide 10, the company's total location inventory has increased from 1,265 at the IPO to approximately 2,090 based on the extensive delineation effort in last year's program."
0,"6 million, our second consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. As of December 31, 2017, we have net operating losses in several geographies in which we currently do business, which will allow us to offset future taxable income to reduce our overall income tax exposure. To that end, we have $13."
0,"6 times at the end of the year, that is a strong capital ratio, particularly in our business risk profile as our firm. So, that allows us to think about that with great flexibility as we enter the cycle. And it's coming up fast, so we'll know more here in the near future."
0,"6% in 2017 to over 78,000 subscribers. We expect that these efforts, among many others, will allow us to maintain a flat to slightly positive organic same-store revenue trend in our largest revenue category, subscription income. One point, I'd like to make clear before we leave this slide is that we do not expect the performance in any individual quarter to necessarily match these full-year 2018 targets for each business line."
0,"6%, while retaining 79. 8% This granular approach to administering our renewal pricing strategy allows us to achieve additional loss ratio improvement through mix of business changes, while continuing to deliver pure rate increases that equal expected claims inflation. Drilling down to the results by line for commercial lines, our largest line of business, general liability, did not experience any reserve development during the quarter."
0,"64 in 2016. At year-end, our NOL was $1 billion, which we expect will allow us to continue to pay minimal cash taxes through 2019. Turning to slide 6 for a discussion of the full-year drivers of our business."

0,"7 was an audited number. And as the auditor is sitting just one   right behind you, I need to limit anything further that I say on that, other than that number has been verified and we feel confident in there. But we're hopeful that there might be another number that will be subsequently verified."
0,75% of our loads are in the sweet spot of 500 miles or less. This allows us to not compete with the rails. We don't truck for exercise.
0,9% of the total value of the investments. And I emphasize that we feel confident about the 12/31 valuations. The write-downs were highly concentrated for borrowers which accounted for about 80% of the total write-down.
0,"A couple things. Again, just to restate what Richard said, we feel confident for 2018. We have good growth in our Wholesale business."
0,"A few years ago, we were running in the low teens. Now we're below 10% and again our idea is to be able to continue to drive that as a percentage of sales lower, which will allow us to expand our margins and allow us to continue to produce free cash flow. So with that I'm going to turn the talk back over to Eric."
0,"A key element of our acceleration plan was to enable the flow of packages between the legacy TNT and FedEx systems prior to full integration. This allows us to direct volumes to the highest service, but the lowest cost networks. This capability is expected to be in place by May 31 of this year."
0,"A large size of our investment portfolio and our stable deposit base provide ample liquidity to fund growth in our loan portfolio. The investment portfolio also allows us to manage interest rate risk effectively, and our slightly asset-sensitive balance sheet will provide a benefit to earnings if interest rates continue to increase. We are also actively managing our capital so that we can provide a good return to our shareholders while planning for longer-term growth."
0,"A lot of it is refining our development program, so we can systematically, what I call mowing the lawn from an AR standpoint. If we can develop a plan where we're mowing the lawn, it allows us to step out our infrastructure very, very in a planned and scheduled fashion without having to step out and spend lots of capital on that step up activity. And then we mentioned the $2."
0,"Absolutely, what we take a look at the composite of the portfolio and our watch list in particular, in stress test what we think different outcomes might be for the year and that's reflected in our guidance. And as it relates to Ascena, you mentioned, we have a great relationship with them and that's really important because it gives you visibility in terms of what that retailer's likely plans are for a particular location and allows us to get ahead of it where it's likely to come back. And then backfill it, which is what we're doing and what we're outperforming."
0,"Additionally, we reinforce our operational efficiency efforts by also focusing on capital efficiency, leveraging technology and using our scale and size to achieve savings to our supply chain. We understand that driving capital efficiency allows us to do more with the same amount of money. In summary, it was a great year of growth, smart investment, and engaged employees, driving efficiencies and quality results, all to benefit our customers."
0,"Additionally, we're learning more about our customers and have grown our known customer files significantly. All of this has allowed us to improve our ability to drive traffic with email, which we believe over time will allow us to shift to advertising dollars. We also continue to test other advertising and have been pleased with the early results."
0,"After quarter-end, we launched our broker direct channel. This channel allows us to access approximately 10% of the U. S."
0,"Again, as we build APIs and we can connect with third-parties, this is going to be increasingly easy for us to do. So, we're very confident that that together with a large end market brand and market shares we have like Brazil, Mexico, Spain and all the other countries will allow us to compete very effectively with these large companies. They're definitely going to take a part of the business, but we also are going to be able, as I said before, to take business away from others and global cash management is one of the examples that I gave you, but there are others."
0,"Again, that's an area we're particularly focused and that sort of the activity in those areas hasn't changed dramatically. We set our stall out sort of the second half of last year and we're particularly focused to capital investment in the second half of last year and the first part of this year to ensure that the local areas where we believe there'll be strong markets, we have invested market there for the short-term, will give us some benefit to those in 2018, but it's really long-term investments that we see will continue to add the foundation that allows us to have the organic growth, which is quite frankly, if you exclude Hope, it's not far off the acquisition-type growth that we have in earnings in the business. So, that gets a lot of focus in our business."

So the services that we put together right now, we put together an assessment that first allows us to go in conduct that inventory, identify where the client is with respect to what their current status of their devices are, as well as what the current status of their procedures are   is, and then make recommendations for them on how to improve their process down the road in terms of managing those devices better and we're working towards essentially a fully Managed Service, where we can actually go in and run those inventories and then periodically test those devices and assist our clients in keeping those devices up-to-date. What's interesting about that is that in the process of doing these reviews and in the first few clients that expressed an interest in having this assessment performed, several of which are very large institutions, we also attracted the attention of several of the biomedical device manufacturers who are talking to us now about not only helping them with securing the devices that they create, but actually helping them secure the devices that they're providing to their hospital clients."
0,All the anticipated starts are on land that we currently own or control. We feel confident in the bottom end of the range and starts in the upper-end of the range or beyond will depend on leasing in our existing projects under development and/or successfully securing final entitlements on several projects or process that continues to get more challenging in today's environment. Our guidance also includes between $50 million and $150 million of acquisitions in 2018.
0,Allstate's approach is to establish continuous connections with customers through either onboard diagnostic port devices or their mobile phones. This allows us to provide customers a more accurate price and lead to more profitable growth just as our introduction of financial responsibility pricing did 15 years ago. Drivewise will also include a broad set of consumer offerings that improve the driving experience later this year.
0,"Almost all of that is due to the tax law change, one piece as you just noted is writing down our deferred liability on the rates. The second piece is that the tax law change allows us to use NOLs indefinitely. And so we had previously had a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets that we're now able to release."
0,"Also the investments which are driven at productivity, they lower the costs. And the more we release to further invest, and you are on a virtuous circle where our cost to income allows us to both invest greater amounts of money to the benefit of our customers and deliver superior returns for our shareholders. We have been repeating this for six years and it is now a reality, with a 46% cost to income and the average of the sector is 60%."
0,"An additional 67 wells are either being completed or waiting on completion. The DUC inventory will allow us to maintain our accelerated completion schedule through the first half of this year, which will be a source of significant production growth through 2018. Moving on to corporate reserves, we ended 2017 with total proved reserves at 363 million barrels of oil equivalent, representing year-over-year growth in excess of 760% and a strong organic replacement rate of 172%."
0,"And actually we converted over in Q1 of last year. We did take a one-time benefit, a big benefit for that which we pro forma-ed out, so as to not to distort the things   trends, but from a behavior point of view, we didn't change anything, we keep measuring ourselves to the sell through, we look at re-sales and get the same amount of information we're getting before, which allows us to do managing of the distributors."
0,"And again, this is an IgE-mediated milk allergy, meaning you still have life-threatening severe reactions to the allergen. We want to see a signal that identifies the dose in the patient population that will allow us to move into a Phase III that we can then pursue and hopefully from the application standpoint, it's a registrational trial. So I think we're excited about the prospects here."
0,"And all of those trends should continue in a positive direction after we realize the synergies that we're projecting from the Alpine acquisition. Over time, we feel confident that the steps we've taken to strengthen the company and increase our earnings power will become more apparent in our reported results. Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Jeff and he'll walk through some of the details of the fourth quarter performance."
0,"And as far as answering your question about filing the BLA and the impact on the timeline, as Sean described, our plan is based on the information request to have the pre-BLA meeting such that most questions are answered such that the filing can be smooth for an appropriate BLA review. So, we feel confident that the timeline that we've discussed and disclosed to the FDA sets us up for what we need to do to get appropriate review of the data and hopefully approval based on the different scenarios we've discussed in the past. So, Sean, is there anything else you wish to add to what I just said?"
0,"And as I mentioned, negotiations were pretty difficult because we were migrating and we were able to migrate 100% of our clients to the new system. We believe that it's a system that, although, where clients will have less flexibility, it will allow us to have that flexibility and to be able to use our inventory and deliver the ratings. Of course, now we are delivering   I mean, we're guaranteeing ratings as it happens in the U."

0,"And as Matt mentioned, in November, we announced a proposal to acquire the balance of the GGP shares that we do not already own. As we saw, following the privatization of Brookfield Office Properties in Rouse, consolidating our GGP portfolio within BPY will allow us to create long-term value in those assets in a way that would simply not be possible under separate ownership. We continue to believe the transaction is in the best interest of both GGP shareholders and BPY unitholders."

0,"And as Steve mentioned, it's manageable, controllable, there's tremendous demand from customers. The positive is a lot of the production that we   if we put a customer on quota it shifted back to the hospital, we feel confident that we can regain and get that share back in a reasonable amount of time. So, again, a little bit slower than we anticipated this year, but a positive that we exit the year and get into next year."
0,"And as we head towards the medium-term plan, we will continue with the current structure. So, once the plans are made, I remember saying that strong management capabilities will allow us to attain our goals. But at any rate, maybe everybody is not so much focused upon the current medium-term plans."
0,"And because of that, you had our competitors being predatory because we enjoy that diversity and we don't have to take some of those projects where many of our competitors or in one industry as an example. So the diversity plays well for us and allows us to maybe take a little bit different tact. But as I've said in my answer to Jamie, I think, there's a herd mentality in the industry in which spending starts they feel like they've got to make sure they're in the head of the queue for everything from pipes and motors and pumps and the like, as opposed to those that are going to be later in the cycle."
0,"And by doing that, we kind of almost instantly integrate their supply chain with ours, number one, which serves some benefits in so far as there are some complementary areas where we use the same suppliers. But second is allows us to put kind of the larger force of say our size into the play in their supplier base as opposed to just the smaller size that they both individually represented in. And with that, we've had obviously very good success in terms of not only keeping their revenue stream going, but also being able to grow it."
0,"And canola requires a significant amount of ammonium sulfate. So this allows us to capture a growing and high margin business, drive down our costs, and then of course some of those tonnes will end up in our retail business as it has historically."
0,"And Chris, part of the transition agreement allows us, as we're moving to lower people count, it allows us to reduce any other slippage. That number is the primary number that we'll be working towards to reduce."
0,"And definitely means that the potential customer base is fairly significant. And if we can ramp up sort of this customer base among SMEs, so it is truly a significant opportunity. And the challenge is to do the marketing and communication in such a manner that you can get your message through, because a true entrepreneur has so many things in his mind or her mind that getting through and reaching his or her bandwidth is a challenge."
0,"And demand, I mean, demand looks very good, again, for a small population. In terms of the filing, as you can imagine, we're actively putting the files together to now, which will include both Haven 3, which is the non-inhibitor data, and also Haven 4, which will allow us to look at different dosing intervals. We intend to file as soon as we can this year."
0,"And doing that, allows us to take the share count down significantly on day one. So, roughly 70% of that will come out of our share count in the March quarter."
0,"And down the road in the future strategically, our guests are always asking us, hey, can you help us set up, can you help us tear down that business catering? And so building the capability set ourselves on the catering side, I think, allows us to explore those kinds of value-added services. On the non-catering side, I think like lunch and dinner, we've got about a little less than half the fleet, right around half the fleet participating in delivery with third-party services."
0,"And even when we do a joint venture, take, for example, the first tower in the Gold Coast, we still have to put equity into the joint venture to build the thing, and then in three to four years down the track, the cash flow coming from the settlement of the apartments. So, in the interim that allows us to accelerate it before some of these investments."
0,"And for a developer to push code to the site is very, very quick and easy. That allows us to test and learn. So, you might ask, Josh, you started in May and you say that the team by the end of the third quarter had already done things that had changed the slope of the GMS curve."
0,"And from BioMarin's perspective, I think our principal interest in pricing reimbursement models is to be able to capture as much value as possible as valrox may provide, number one on a clinical value basis, number two on the quality of life value basis, and number three in terms of cost offsets through what is a very expensive lifelong treatment regimen today. So we want to capture as much value as possible across all three of those dimensions, and we're open to different reimbursement models that will allow us to capture that value."
0,"And guidance, look, we think there was a bit of uncertainty around the 43-plus number that we had before. And we just wanted to take away the speculation and just give a more ranged position that was a big tighter in regard to the eyes of people and we feel confident that we'll hit well within that range, Nick. The assets, we're becoming more a group business."
0,"And I say that, because in some instances we employ excess of loss. In others, we have certain strategic quota shares in place, where we can get paid an appropriate and profitable ceding commission to underwrite some of those, and allows us to put out some larger limits. So, I think, in particular, some of that impact is probably being seen in Professional lines business."
0,"And I think importantly, we have an agency strategy, and within that strategy we sell most of our accounts on a package basis. Within that package, we have different lines of businesses, coverages moving in different directions, and we consider all those, look at every policy individually and we feel confident that we're in a position to address some of these rising trends that we see, we feel that we book them in our reserves and we have confidence in the continuation of the profitability of the casualty line."
0,"And I think that side of it where it's much more clinical messaging, much more procedure-based, making sure that it's part of the protocol of the hospitals to have this as an integral part of the treatment regimen, it's part of the scheduling and so on, I think that is much handled   better handled by us. And the thing that I really like about that idea is that it allows us to incrementally build our sales team rather than having to hire a lot of people in one shot, which it can be very expensive. This will become more of an incremental model."
0,"And I think we've made very clear to the markets and very transparent that we're very much a shareholder-friendly company. We have a real capital-efficient model that generates 35%, 40% cash-on-cash returns, very strong model that allows us to generate excess free cash flow that we'll continue to return to shareholders in the form of the buyback program."
0,"And I think you can see here we've made some really nice improvements. I talked about the importance of NPS, as it relates to loyalty, but also the customer satisfaction part of that allows us to expose where our branch network is not achieving the necessary customer satisfaction rates for us to get the price. We continue to grow rates and we continue to give a bi-annual rate increase with very little customer attrition."
0,"And I think, as a philosophy or approach with the company of NanoString's development stage and revenue profile is important to balance, what I call a realistic forecast with reasonable conservatism. And to establish the range we feel confident that we can meet, but that we have a reasonable chance to exceed. And so I think that's what you see inputted into the numbers that we presented."
0,"And I want to just   maybe just want to add to that, which is that today's announcement of breakthrough therapy designation allows us to engage now early and often with the regulators in that discussion as opposed to being what you might traditionally can see for other products. We're just sort of waiting for formal end of Phase 2 meetings."
0,"And I would put the risk, I guess, probably a little bit more on the SG&A side, I guess. We feel confident about the gross margin plans."
0,"And I'd say, as we said many times, we're the smallest of the so-called Big Six global bearing players. And I think our size allows us to be a little bit more selective. We don't really participate in the mass market ball bearing industry."
0,"And if it takes more time, it's better for us because it allows us to replace that revenue with revenue from other customers, especially in TCTL."
0,"And if they do, we like our chances in winning if they come into our store. So that you know from a pricing standpoint, the market is since I've been with the company, we've faced skirmishes all over the country, and that's a part of being in retail, a part of something that we have to react to we feel confident in the way that we can react to it."
0,"And if you say Discovery, Animal Planet, ID, TLC, HG, Food, Travel, Oprah and all of that, we represent, let's say together, maybe 20% of the viewing on television, but we're less than 10% of the money. And so, we think that we're in a good place, and that allows us to be creative. We're having a lot of discussions now about mobile, because we think a lot of the IP that we own here in the U."
0,"And if you want to have a conversation with a friend, you have a certain expectation of privacy, but you don't necessarily have that expectation and you're going to be held to account if you want to talk to a million people. And for us making that distinction between broadcasting and communication allows us to continue to develop our communications products, and support privacy and a lot of the great features that we have today, but also, at the same time, develop our broadcast products and also make sure that the content that people are creating on the broadcast side lives up to our standards and values."
0,"And in the case of MyoSure at least, this is a market that continues to grow nicely. And we even think in the case of NovaSure there is significant opportunity to make sure that patients as well as physicians know that you don't have to get a hysterectomy if you have abnormal uterine bleeding. There are much faster, less invasive techniques out there such as NovaSure that can solve the problem for the patient."
0,"And in this last, this last handful of years we've been working on some major league data analytics across all of our businesses, but there's a lot of work being done that's even out   certainly outside of the mortgage business even that we can bring to bear in mortgage, which we think will drive more business our way, and in ways that 5 years or 10 years ago you just wouldn't be able to do. So having a platform like this built allows us to deploy some of that stuff, and I think in ways that will be a lot of fun for us."
0,"And it guarantees that their insights stay their insights, which is really important to our clients. So incumbency again it allows us to understand their process. It allows us to build new technologies into the way they operate."
0,"And it's a constant to-do list that we have, so it's ever-changing. But we've had some nice wins and we've been able to lower some of our call volumes, which allows us to help customers with real issues they have around trading or around needing help."
0,"And it's a great relationship. It allows us to continue to have a full suite of products that includes the post-acute market space. We get to reap the benefits of   again, we consolidate the full P&L and balance sheet into our results."
0,"And it's not only in upper funnel advertising but also when you get into the deal, be able to sit there and say, hey listen, you're spending   this is your revenue today, this is your revenue once you're on the network, this is your cost today, this is your cost once you're on the network, this is why we know this, these are orthopods in the northeast just like you, and we can benchmark that, right. And I think that allows us to have a different level of conversation that we can today. I can tell you that our cost of bookings is going down in 2018."
0,"And just like you said, the goal of that account manager is to serve as the trusted advisor and that one single point of contact for the customer. And really, by doing that, it allows us to build relationships with the customer, better understand their needs, which enables us to match their needs with our Compliance Services. So, traditionally, our up-sell and cross-sell has been more of a transactional model."
0,"And last but not least, in the second half of this year, we start with a big upgrade of our transport network where we will start the upgrade of 800 notes with new cards. This will allow us to cope with the expected steep increase in big traffic where you see here that we plan to upgrade interfaces from 10 gigabits to 100 gigabits per second to cope with that increasing traffic growth on our core network. On the IT transformation, three big buckets, the first one is to finalize the fully convergent IT stats for our mass market services where we have completely new stack for all our fixed and mobile and converged product."
0,"And lastly, and Bob alluded to this before, we're looking to really expand our footprint as it relates to multi-asset real assets. So we have a pending product launch in our offshore fund lineup, which will allow us to actually take our show over there as well."
0,"And let me give you a bit of pointers, our tax rate non-GAAP was 22%. The tax reform will allow us to go to a rate of about 18% and then the 18% to 16% is due to a tax restructuring plan we have in place. This plan is now going to allow us to fully optimize the tax structure of the company and the tax reform has been a really a vector of acceleration of the implementation of this plan."
0,"And look, the franchisees want to have profitable unit, so part of the issue   one of the biggest things we did for them in 2017 and 2018 was we forgave closure fees. Contract allows us to charge the remainder of the contract for a store that's closed. So what we did in order to encourage 2017 and 2018's changes was to forgive those fees, and as a result, we've actually approved more closures that have happened, but for the most part, the franchisees are working through the units that we both agree are not viable."
0,"and now expect to complete this process after the close of the market on April 4. This timing will allow us to hold our Annual Meeting of Shareholders on April 4, as presently scheduled. Our Special Meeting for (sic) [of] Stockholders to vote on the redomiciliation will still be held on March 23."
0,"And now, with triple-negative, we've prioritized that but in collaboration with Bristol-Myers and they're in fact running that study. So, it's been really helpful to us to have that collaboration not only because we think the combination will be really important for patients but having Bristol-Myers commit both financially and operationally to the programs allows us to have them prioritize for instance the triple-negative breast study while we focus on the ovarian. So, it's a nice balance for us."
0,"And on the FUEL CHEM business, we think we've reached a stable level of activity for our FUEL CHEM business. So without being specific in terms of how things are going to shake out quarter-to-quarter, we're just, generally, we're seeing a little bit of a better revenue trend as we roll into 2018 than we did into 2017 and we feel confident about that."
0,"And one other thing that we're seeing, it's more of a timing issue as well as is that our technology costs this quarter will be about $10 million higher this quarter than last quarter as well. And so, both of those are more timing related or reflected in our full-year outlook and so we feel confident in our ability to achieve that. But just want to make sure we had an opportunity to highlight that."
0,"And our belief is we have the best transponders in the world. So, it will allow us to go   continue to win more and more footprint. Obviously, since we're not deploying all the common infrastructure that's lower margin, it also will help to the margin side of the equation."
0,"And our international businesses delivered significant earnings growth with pressures from the energy transition in China more than offset by good progress from our value restoration program in Australia. This solid performance allows us to strengthen our already robust financial structure and increase our dividends to shareholders. Overall financially, we've achieved steady growth in earnings while maintaining a strong financial structure and investing for the future."
0,"And our network of ISRs have been working early in the sales process to collect this information and share it through the network of our ISRs. And we turn every incoming lead that we get from Dodge into a Job Profile and it evolves over time, but that allows us to prioritize our sales process and then we're able to take a look and say, hey, how well did we do on each jobsite, what was our activation share per Job Profile. So, here is a quick journey I'll take you on, talk a little bit more about our Job Profile process."
0,"And our operations, our manufacturing folks do an excellent job of continuing to drive for continuous improvement and increase in efficiencies and we continue to see the benefit of that. So, we saw some of that in Q2, obviously, with higher volumes that allows us to get better margins. In addition, we did have this product mix element."
0,"And our technology can enable us to comprehend and understand what they embedded in their questions. So, this allows us to provide more accurate and more relevant and direct answers. Currently, 5% of our search queries can get direct answers and we plan to increase our percentage to 10%."
0,"And part of the reason why we settled on this type of transaction was to remove the warrant liability entirely. That allows us to have an owner's equity, which is about enough to allow us to up-list to Nasdaq. The other big barrier is, obviously, the stock price."
0,"And please forgive us that this is not really so specific, because, well, it's about product mix, it's really about profit mix, and we will see how these things turn out. But based on 2017, I think we feel confident that this will be the outcome, and certainly this is a significant benefit for the company moving forward. And you know what I said last year, I think the group core tax rate is a bit artificial."
0,"And quite frankly, we've got some   we're working on partnerships as well as with the open architecture of providing open line systems and being able to provide our transponders, our ICE4 transponders over other networks. It allows us to gain more competitive footprint. We currently have a nice backlog of open ICE trials."
0,"And so it's going to limit how many units we have available for commercial sales in the fourth quarter and first quarter, but we think that we should clear that hurdle and get this product line moved into Edwards facilities in pretty short order. And as we do that, it will allow us to get out a more normal ramp. By comparison, PASCAL was not an acquired product, but a product line that was built within the Edwards system, so we won't have those same kind of system migration issues, and I would expect that not to go through the same sort of process."
0,"And so that's been the key focus. And then as we've been looking at the portfolio, certainly, some of the work that we've done around the tax reform and those type of things, taken those into consideration as we think about the portfolio longer term that do we have other alternatives that allows us to reposition or be able to pursue strategic alternatives, and then, how do we then utilize those proceeds and ultimately be positioned to create shareholder value beyond what we think we're positioned to do today. And so that's been the process, what we communicated yesterday, and certainly look forward to the continued discussion here today."
0,"And so they want to make sure that we're on the hook forever, we're going to be around forever. And so that's why maintaining a strong balance sheet is very important for a lot of reasons, but not the least in which from a selling standpoint, it allows us to kind of have kind of thoughtful conversation with our customers around the long-term stability of the business. Here is our free cash flow."
0,"And so we believe that this delivers the greatest value with the lowest risk for us and we don't necessarily have to tie our self to one type of financing product. We can have multiple and our platform because we own it, allows us to deliver those."
0,"And so we have a very robust narrow network product for 250,000 employees, that's comprehensive from a coverage standpoint, but incents everybody to use an HCA facility where they can. And I think from that standpoint, when you look at our healthcare costs as a large employer, we have a unique model that allows us to manage costs, I think, very effectively. And our trend has been probably better than the average   the industry average for our healthcare costs."
0,And so we have ongoing discussions across all of our portfolio around transactions that will materially improve our balance sheet. And materially improving our balance sheet will allow us to increase the rate of return on everything else we own. And that's what our asset sale program will continue to be focused on.
0,"And so we'll have more insight, at least, she will have more insight into how we can contribute at the governance level. But long story short, I think it's a very good company and I think we have good relationships that will allow us to find opportunities together."
0,"And so what we did, is we'll drill an area and then just continue to step out basically increasing the footprint from the inside out. And that allows us to just be able to tack on to the infrastructure as we move forward. And of course that keeps you know we don't jump over one area and add a whole bunch of PUDs in another area and add a whole bunch of PUDs."
0,"And so, actually, if you would have kept Arizona at historic levels, there would have been strong growth in Q1. So, the reason why we feel confident in the growth returning and coming back in Q2 and beyond is the following. Nevada is coming back which   quite strongly."
0,"And so, although with the combination of TS and Tech Data, we have a very strong end-to-end position in the marketplace. The combination also allows us to see even more clearly where targeted investments can differentiate us even further. And so, I think you have to factor in there the idea that there will be organic investments to continue to add to our value proposition."
0,"And so, hopefully, what you also heard this morning was that more and more agencies and then also the bodies that set standards like IATA are saying they value the GDS as complexity continues to increase. And so we feel confident about our ability to continue to provide content in an environment where people like to comparison shop."
0,"And so, it's this need to actually tie that visibility into remediation and into action that is actually starting the conversations at a very, very early level. And that allows us to actually position the work that we've done around how do you actually take the visibility and how do you actually turn that into remediation steps that you actually need to take. How do you actually take that visibility and how do you actually turn it into basically things that people care about."
0,"And so, that's just a human experience. So globally, no matter whether you're in Japan, or Singapore, or China, or the United States or wherever, we have a sense that conversing with a user experience will allow us to get a transaction done. And this is why, it's a global phenomenon."
0,"And so, that's why we pursue that transaction, very happy to do that transaction because it does give us leverage. It also allows us to be more expansive in the conversations we have with our customers."
0,"And so, we have vendors supplying us parts and things like that, but we basically create those things ourself. And we've done that forever and the plan is continue doing that, because the knowledge, the know-how, the IP, it's very, very proprietary to us and we believe that our process, our technology allows us to deliver the highest quality silicon carbide wafers on earth, which is why there is a tremendous amount of demand from all of these suppliers. And again, I'll come back and reference in the Infineon agreement, they made an announcement as well and they actually talked about the quality of the product itself."
0,"And so, we're talking to several partners. We'll most likely wait for some of the revenue numbers to come in because we think that the revenue numbers if they're in line with our forecasts will allow us to get maximum value from the deals. So most likely a deal won't happen in immediate future but the discussions are ongoing."
0,"And so, when we see that, I think some of that's reflected in the strength of our enrollment. Our view as a board was that it was time to get back into the investment mode and expand our brand in a way that allows us to build the university. Karl, why don't you run through sort of the economics on the near-term basis?"
0,"And that   and it was still a bit above our expectations from our original plan. But we really feel that the stabilization we've seen and the pricing that we've put in place will allow us to appropriately cover our inflation in 2018. I mean, it's an important assumption, but we have seen stabilization."
0,And that allows a very low cost yet at the same time scalable and adaptable design of the panels. The ability to include real-time PCR allows us to leverage a vast portfolio of real-time PCR technology that we have here internally and now combine it into highly multiplex panels. And this is also a further uniqueness.
0,"And that allows us to then win some of the largest jobs. So part of what we've done is anticipate which sectors we think will have mini booms and focus making sure we have the industry expertise so we disproportionately win in those, and we've invested a lot in there."
0,"And that has   what we've been able to do even with what's happened with bonus depreciation with the reduction in the ADIT and reduction in cash flows, we've still been able to keep that investment essentially unchanged. We changed it $500 million in the third year of our forecast, but by being able to keep that investment essentially the same, that allows us to stay in that growth range."
0,"And that is a fairly crowded market that hasn't got particularly attractive returns in it. And so, we are much more interested in refocusing it to focus on off-grid type opportunities with a rental leased type product; and believe that that is a marketplace that has no particularly large players in who have the same kind of capability that we have; and that deploying Younicos into that space will allow us to generate the types of returns that we would expect from a rental business. And I would say exactly the same for C&I behind the meter."
0,"And that is pretty much data-driven. If the response data are even higher than what we have seen clearly, it will allow us to accelerate the program even more."
0,"And that makes all the difference in the world. We want that ladder I think competitively it make all the sense in the world, and structurally it allows us to be very overt about what we do under the umbrella of having been granted that clearance from the world's number one healthcare entity, the FDA. So, that was the directional change and that will add time, but it adds an order of magnitude more values to what we're doing."
0,"And that represents by far the largest chunk of our audience. It's the healthiest kind of most engaged and most loyal part of our audience, which is what allows us to be so effective from a modernization perspective, and in fact continue to grow RPMs even though there has not been a ton of audience growth over the last year or so. The places where I think we need to do better are with the younger audience."
0,"And that rigor and discipline will be something that we put in place here, and I'm not saying it doesn't exist. But the level of focus that I will have with this team in putting a process together that allows us to feel more confident in the guidance that we give will be something that we do. And it's not new to me, and there is process that I'm used to following and we're going to make sure that we bring that here."
0,"and that's products that are being supplied through our Loveland's business. And so, as we think about building out our Retail business in Brazil, Agrichem is really a strategic acquisition for us, because it really allows us to feed in specialty nutrients into what we want to have as an expanding retail footprint in Brazil. So, it's a market, as Chuck said, that's growing."
0,"And the benefit of having the platform is for those who don't have the capabilities and want to move more quickly, we can provide a more full turnkey solution. On the flipside, for those that want a portion, having the ability or the understanding of the full systems allows us to enhance the parts. So, actually, that's one."
0,"And the company did significantly improve its financial performance as oil prices were falling. But no, I very much agree that I think that, as I said, the best protection for a company in our business is to have a very strong balance sheet, which allows us to weather the commodity cycle. And that's really where my focus is on."
0,"And the discussions with international IKEA are in a very good stage as we speak. We don't have any announcements to make today but we feel confident that all those negotiations and discussions over the last two years will give result. Now, in terms of new concept development, we also have finalized the sector we want to be in and also the concept and most likely the partner that we want to be in."
0,"And the folks we're competing against are one or the other, either they are providers of services like in fund administration, but then, they're using a third-party vendor technology or they're using other forms of technologies that they have built but are not really commercially available. And so, what that allows us to do and I think this is one of the reasons why we've been really successful in some of the outsourcing businesses, what that allows us to do is look at these problems as I can solve this with people or I can solve this with technology. Over time, technology is the lower cost way to do it, right?"
0,"And the only area that's going up has been heap leach, which gone up by 11% and that's because of the considerable reduction in the amount of tonnes that we've been processing. And this is I'm really glad of this question because that actually allows us to give you a detailed feel and you get more on the Investor Day on actually how we've been driving down these costs, even though in some areas we've been facing those  where we've been facing period inflationary headwinds, but in some areas we've been reducing the tonnage as well. Greg, you got anything else to add to that?"
0,"And the question I often get is like, hold on, I understand you have 3D printed products, but can't Medtronic or J&J or NuVasive purchase a 3D printer then they have a 3D printed product. And the part that I think got lost for a while there in the discussion is really understanding that what 3D printing allows us to do is simply manufacture in ways we've never been able to before. So if any of you in the room are following us know that our kind of flagship product has been our MESA deformity product for the complex spine kids, for deformity in kids, and that's a low profile screw that's very different and functions different from anything else in the market and has a lot of intellectual property around it, right."
0,And the reason that is important to us is we had already established a strong technical position. But the service business allows us to interact with higher levels of the customers. And I remember an event that really colored my thinking a little bit about that a few years ago where happened to talk to the CTO of Hyundai which is a very large Korean car company.
0,"And the second is for the treasury issues. Now, here, with the treasury issues, now we have a new decree from the regulator that will allow us to recover completely this hit in, say, 18, 24 months. So in 18, 24 months, you will see positive impact because of this recovery."
0,"And the way we think about it is to the extent we get early incremental savings from some of these longer term initiatives, that might be offset by investments but it would be incremental savings offset by incremental investment. So it basically nets out to nothing, which allows us to hit the numbers that Brian was talking about."
0,"And then most recently because we see these four pillars and then the ability to have a common data models and a common data layer which we think can be disruptive, we brought onboard Ali, who came from IBM and he is a Former CTO for machine learning from them. And the idea is built up the team and then that allows us to get from a company that's been growing at a steady pace to a company that can be positioned to grow significantly faster than that. It's obviously a work in progress, but I've been   I mean, if you think about it, very significant up-leveling addition to the overall team to what was already a strong team and it happened from February to October/November timeframe, and happened generally seamlessly and that's a testament to the people that we have at 8x8 were amazing and recognizing their strengths and weaknesses and basically welcoming people who had more skill sets and the new team that came in and seamlessly kind of gelled."
0,"And then the last piece is productization and that's where we really excel. The ability to take the underlying NAND, put it into products and we can deploy those in retail, we can deploy those in client applications and we can deploy those in the enterprise and we do that both in hard drives and in flash, we believe better than anyone and that really allows us to operate at significantly higher gross margins than many of our competitors."
0,"And then we have an analytics product that predictive analytics module called Insight that allows customers to look at data new and innovative ways and provides even more efficiency in executable business intelligence to their operations. TrackX Connect allows us to support the interface and connectivity to the millions of dollars of investment that companies have spent in backend ERP systems and unlock the value of those products. So, really what we're doing is if you look at where companies today are spending money on IT, it's digital transformation, Big Data and the Internet of Things."
0,"And then when we really start to see more of the restructuring plan kick in, in 2019, that should give us an additional cash flow to help pay down debt. So we feel confident, but there are things that we will be having to look at and we will be looking to see if additional minor divestments can help pay down debt even more rapidly in 2018."
0,"And then, it used to stop there. What Conversant allows us to do is to plug-in the digital back end of that. So that now I can take that information rather than putting it on someone's statement or a mail or something like that I'm either doing a very personalized permission-based e-mail, or I'm reaching out over your mobile device and those ads that pop up that are very personalized, that stuff that we do."
0,"And then, of course, the third one is the new products, the FLEX4 and kicking these guys out of our accounts probably. So, those three things, okay, will allow us to continue to add new customers and to maintain our existing ones. Ross, you're on."
0,"And there are three serious or material sort of marketing perfections if you will. One is allowing charitable premium assistance that allows us to do exactly what was intended, which is to help some of these people get covered. And that does lead to there being more commercial patients."
0,"And there is just a long list of getting next-gen Deep Brain Stimulation System by the time you get to 2021. So I think we feel like given the diversification of the portfolio, the adjacent markets and the new launches we have, it's a wide range, 5% to 8%, but we feel confident that there's good visibility into that."
0,"And there was a lot of interest and the first layer of the tax law, which is just the overall lowering of the corporate tax rate, the change 14% from 35% to 21%, which generally is a good thing because it makes us more efficient. It helps keep our rates low and allows us to get more capital in the ground. But as I described it to the regulators, and I was on this panel with Moody's and some Commissioner and Executive Director of Water division within one state, I called it the good, the bad, the ugly."
0,And these companies also have the opportunity to pick up on our cost synergies and their increased size allows us to increase our purchasing power and spread that purchasing power across the entire system.
0,"And this formula does include compensation for steel price increases, but as I said, not immediately. So, of course, it's difficult to quantify when exactly we will pass all these increases but just very roughly we believe that during the first half, the increase in price which have been physically increased according to the formula in first quarter will allow us to pass those costs. But, of course, we still see some inflation trend and still although smaller to a smaller extent than it was in the second half last year."
0,"And this is a study that's the largest that's ever been conducted in nearly 250 patients with another nearly 200 patients in the 302 study, largest program by far that's ever been conducted in PNH. And we think the data is very robust and consistent, and allows us to differentiate ALXN1210 from eculizumab."
0,"And this part of the process did take longer than we originally anticipated, but we're moving through it very well now. And this added time will allow us to incorporate all of this data into the BLA in a very high quality fashion."
0,"And to do all of that, we need to, of course, yet again, unleash the power of our employees. So, that will allow us to make the right choices and invest for growth. We think we have the right strategies to confront the future that's in front of us."
0,"And to remind everybody who isn't familiar with what that is, an exemptive order is something that you need from the SEC in order to allocate a deal across several different investment funds that are managed by the same manager. In our case we do have two other private BDCs in addition to GSBD and that gives us a balance sheet that allows us to be relevant to some of these larger transactions, and since we can allocate these transactions across our three different clients, it means we can speak for a larger hold size, and as they say makes us much more relevant. So as they say, a combination of a lot of hard work in developing relationships with a really important sponsor, the benefit of having Goldman alums in key locations within that sponsor and having real specialized expertise in the relevant industry as well as the ability to speak for size because of our co-investment order, those are really the factors that allowed us to win these transactions."
0,"And to say that in other words, one of validation tests run in Poland, we want to be sure that those results are accepted by off-sites and our customers so that we don't need to rerun the test. And in fact now the status of every validation lab is visible in all other labs, it's a very visual system allows us to load level demand globally and easily. So why do I spend time on this with you?"
0,"And upon closing, it is expected to be immediately and meaningfully accretive to non-GAAP EPS. The transaction also allows us to realize synergies with Viavi's operational infrastructure and U. S."
0,"And we believe this is critical because many of our customer, and the average age is 62 years old, when they come to a dealership, they never had the powersport product and you need to facilitate the passage of their license. Then, this is what we're doing right now and we feel confident about the plan."
0,"And we continue to be very focused on our licensing business. Licensing for us is a very important piece as it allows us to go into markets in a very easy way and less expensive than building a formal infrastructure. As well as over the last couple of years, we've closed close to 15 underperforming doors, which we felt was the best thing for the business which turned around the negative DTC business to a positive contributor to the company."
0,"And we did it through a combination of expense control, inventory control and how we ran things as a company. So we have a flexible structure that allows us to be able to respond responsibly in a cycle and have consistent growth and profitability."
0,"And we do expect strong growth in the RBL going forward with each redetermination. We are currently sitting with a very strong current and projected leverage and liquidity position, which will allow us to execute our growth plans in the Delaware Basin over the next several years. We do not have any needs under our current business plan that would require raising outside capital."
0,"And we have been delivering this mainly with an off-market approach as you can see in the charts below, and mainly with a value-add component that is very consistent and complementary with the level, the high level of prime CBD exposure that Colonial has. So the strategy that   of acquisition that will allow us to remain with a very solid track record remains in place. So, in order to end the part of our conclusions, we'll start in page 52."
0,"And we have been making good progress in addressing the issues we had last year. So although early in the year, we feel confident so far of achieving the gradual step-up in restoring profitability. Also on the positive side, we expect the Aircraft Division to perform strongly, leveraging higher volumes."
0,And we have to understand those different contexts. And so that's why things like Content Specific Ranking and other categorization tools and other techniques like that are so important because that allows us to serve the buyers better when they come for different reasons.
0,"And we think it's a great way. Is it going to work, we don't know, but it allows us to enter into the field in a way that's not like a wedge going after CD19, like every other company. And that tends to be our philosophy is to not follow, fast or slow follow the leaders, but to really try to learn from science and take approaches that are somewhat orthogonal."
0,"And we think that that could be a good analog for what we're facing in these cases, which is really supporting the value proposition of the product and educating the market in a number of cases which is true here to a biologic drug and the change of clinical practice associated with that. But again, we feel confident of our success and we believe we're realistic in terms of what it's going to take to win."
0,And we will work to provide a positive outcome in our North Dakota rate case. We believe this will allow us to deliver on our 2018 guidance of $1. 80 to $1.
0,"And we'll continue to enroll patients into the second cohort. The plan is to currently enroll up to 30 patients in that second cohort, but more importantly, it allows us to   we made decision from a manufacturing standpoint now to begin a dialogue with the Agency to talk about a registration path forward."
0,"And we're continuing to drive operating improvements. I mean, we feel confident of doing   being able to do more with less across this enterprise, from each of the segment leaders in terms of what they're talking about and equally balance sheet management. So I talked about the first down payment some of the five days in terms of working capital and DSO."
0,"And we're growing with a lot of them. These are the changes he's conducting which will allow us to grow a lot, but with dozens of stores in order to meet the growth percentage. And for eCommerce, some points to be clarified, as we presented eCommerce and technology does not include the whole component like Mario Colin which includes the CapEx component which is in the budget for remodels and the same with logistics part of the investment in DCs which will help an eCommerce business."
0,"And we're just going to be in constant dialogue with our regulatory partners to make sure they understand everything that we're doing, that they're comfortable with what we're doing, that everything we're doing complies with their specific circumstances related to not only their state laws and regulations, but any of the agreements that we've signed. So, I don't think there's an easy blanket answer, but we would hope that   but in the long term by acquiring PHH and moving to their platform, which should happen sooner than if we do it on our own, that it will allow us to eventually get to the point to resume growth sooner than we would otherwise be able to do on our own. John, thanks for your questions."
0,"And we've also added some value-added assets that you may have seen in the Q4 release that have the ability for higher internal growth. Last thing I'll say is, as we look around the market today, we don't have a cost to capital that allows us to continue external growth. My own personal belief is there's been an overreaction in the marketplace and indiscriminate selling across the REIT sector, and there's not a look through to the asset quality of the underlying REITs."
0,"And we've been cleaning up a lot of that and making sure that we can scale and also building up a discipline that we can apply machine learning to every surface area of the product, and I feel really confident in our ability to do that. And that allows us to move a whole lot faster in 2018 and be a lot smarter about how we introduce tweets and also events and accounts to people right where they spend the majority of their time, which is in the timeline. I'll turn it over to Ned for the tentpole events."
0,"And we've now brought that third shift back. We, in fact, need the capacity and when the factory is open 24 hours a day, it creates some flexibility, which it simply allows us to respond more quickly to changes in demand. But there is always a little bit of fixed cost with each shift supervision and maintenance personnel need to be on staff in addition to direct labor."
0,And we've seen a lot of success with that. And that allows us to stay current with some more innovation that we might not otherwise be able to invest in on our own. And so we've seen a lot of return for that as well.
0,"And we've structured these MindSphere application centers around the customer, so around the segment of business; food and beverage, energy, whatever the case is. And that allows us to really pull all of the capability from Siemens into delivering then solutions to those customers in that segment. So we really structured it from the customer back as opposed to from our Siemens' organization forward."
0,"And what City National has done well in protecting those niches is they've combined that with technology. So this Datafaction technology that we have allows us to take our cash management linkage and create connectivity to our customers that's very difficult to unlock. And therefore, you have to look at defensible niches when you don't have scale that leverage technology."
0,And what does that allow us to do? That allows us to provide analytics and insights to our manufacturing customers. Manufacturing customers can use this to do predictive analysis.
0,"And what I mean by that is the combination of availability, performance, accuracy and security; that is the backbone of our business still to these days. And that's what allows us to build all of the cool stuff that my colleagues here have been talking about for the past couple hours. But make no mistake about it, we feel very, very proud of our reliability engineering and in fact, especially for our sophisticated and larger customers."
0,"And what it does is, it allows the property management companies that manage short-term vacation rentals to monetize the booking of those rentals in a more efficient way. We just introduced the next generation of that product, which is fundamentally a complete rewrite, which we call Kigo Marketplace, and that model allows us to monetize anywhere from 3% to 5% of the booking value of every night that is granted. Now, just to give you a flavor for this, we have how many night sales?"
0,"And what that's allowed us to do is to be scalable and flexible because again these applications are built using micro services and with the products being focused on cloud deployment, as I think about taking a product that's been successful in North America and driving it out through a focused sales campaign in Asia, I can scale that because of the cloud infrastructure. That allows us to be faster, efficient and ultimately more stable and secure than any other platform in the marketplace. And what that's also helped us to do is be successful as we start to serve the enterprise chains."
0,"And when you talk about a fundamental shift in architecture, you need to have that understanding. And it allows us to help our OEM customers move from where they are today to the car as a digital platform. And then the final point is power distribution because redundancy, moving power efficiently around a vehicle is absolutely fundamental to these platforms."
0,"And where I think a lot of our power lies is the insights around what happened. So, not just what's happening right now but what happened and recaps, so Moments is a great example of a recap product that allows us to tell a fully cohesive, end-to-end, all sides of perspective, story around any particular topic or event. So, really excited to complement our very real-time nature of what's happening with a much larger market, which is what happened because only a certain percentage of the world can see something live."
0,And with that we have a placebo-controlled trial. We have had the conversations with the agencies about both of those trials and that allows us to deal with those patients that are at their episodic stage that might be moderate or mild at that time. Both trials gave us a chance to deal with the episodic nature of the disease I think when you put them together.
0,"And, Paul, I'd just add one other thing is that I think longer term not only is there a tailwind associated with it, but I do think it will allow us to simplify our structures. So over the years, we've created a lot of legal entities and other structures to try to optimize tax on a global basis."
0,"Andrew this is Jon. We plan to continue to grow our store base in the coming year, so there's no strategic change away from growing, of course our format allows us to be successful as Kevan was mentioning earlier and some of the stores that we're opening this year kind of clarify that we're going to very large MSAs with a few and we're going to some less scaled areas with others. On the question of how many for next year and the year beyond is a   in each year planning process, we're going to be evaluating a retail landscape, interest rates and our financial objectives of free cash flow and debt reduction as part of the 2019 store growth plan and probably in the coming discussions, we'll talk more specific about how many 2019 will include."
0,"Another example of Lee's comment that our asset management business is not driven by the balance sheet. It's driven by the actual servicing capabilities that we have that helps other people move the assets into our network, and then onto our platforms and then allows us to participate in those deals. We got to do a small off-market investment in the equity of that securitization."
0,"Appreciate that. Well, on the Revere line, we have a number of assets that we can refinance currently that will allow us to pay down the Revere line, and we are significantly along in discussions to do that. I can't right now disclose exactly who it is that's going to be stepping into that position, but we have been deeply in discussions on hitting that loan, and we are confident we'll have that one paid off prior to maturity on April 30."
0,"Argentina's Humid Pampas, the country's corn-belt region, along with the northeast region, are amongst the most affected by the dry weather. As for Adecoagro, and thanks to the geographic diversification of our production unit, coupled with the implementation of best practices such as multi-production and adequate crop rotation allows us to significantly mitigate the negative effect. As an example, soy and corn are being negatively affected."
0,"As a company, we remain focused on operational execution including cost containment as we await further improvements in near-term demand for our business. While we feel confident in our competitive position in the market, we remain mindful of the uncertainty around timing of additional tender awards in China. The elimination of the inventory overhang at our customers is a meaningful first step to growth in 2018."
0,"As a point in reference, we have incurred approximately $23 million in legal costs since fiscal 2014 with legal settlements in excess of $100 million during this time period. While there are no assurances of future settlements, we feel confident in our legal status in this case. On a GAAP basis, we reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 a net loss of $914,000 or $0."
0,"As a reminder, our LR work does not impact our medium-term CapEx guide. The LR option allows us to convert the existing A321neo orders, but the aircraft is not scheduled to be available until the end of 2019. Turning to our balance sheet on slide 16."
0,"As far as the impact on mSToPS, this is still early days. The results as you say, if they're good, will allow us to begin to affect guidelines and those guidelines would then allow us to translate that into policy work with health plans and some health plans may be quicker than others, but we still have to go down through the kind of remuneration path if you will. We are screening for atrial fibrillation, so we have to make sure that there are coverage policies in place for dealing with asymptomatic patients versus symptomatic patients."
0,"As far as the life of mine goes on resources and reserves including resources and how we trancelike that over time will depend on drilling and the studies. We tend to quote and do our reserves on the detailed mine planning and off the back of the studies, but at the moment we've done a Life of Mine planning of the existing resources and reserves that the work will allow us to do an update especially when we finish some of the drilling that we're just finishing now at the usual time we do it at the end of the financial year."
0,"As far as the other learnings from Phase 2, one that was very important obviously was the subgroup that we pre-specified, which now formed the inclusion criteria for Phase 3, which is selecting a group that has a more predictable trajectory. And we think that that mitigates some of the heterogeneity that we see in the disease and also allows us to have a more predictable outcome from the study. The third thing that we learned in Phase 2 was biomarkers, and that was very informative, both to confirm the mechanism of action of NurOwn, because we believe that NurOwn has a dual mechanism of action in terms of elaboration of neurotrophic factors and also immunomodulation."
0,"As I have said before, a sophisticated market is good news for Howdens. Addressing complexity successfully is what allows us to generate margin and cash and you have seen our results. We ended 2017 with around Â£240 million of cash and we returned Â£160 million to shareholders by dividends and share repurchases during the year."
0,"As I mentioned before, if you want to meet us let Bank of America or our Investor Relations team know. We will try to be tomorrow in New York if the snow allows us to make it somehow. Thank you very much to everybody."
0,"As I mentioned, we reported record annual earnings as we surpassed $107 million. Consistent with our stated strategy, we announced the merger agreement with First Sentry Bancshares, which allows us to cross the $10 billion asset threshold during the first half of 2018. We are maintaining strong market positions across our legacy in major metropolitan markets and have continued to benefit from our core funding advantage from shale energy related deposits in our legacy markets."
0,"As I previously mentioned, we've taken a very deliberate approach to balancing our business by products, customer, market and region, and this remains an important element to our value creation philosophy. This balance, combined with our operating model, allows us to adapt our business to change in the market dynamics such as the light-duty diesel decline, regulatory driven demand for cleaner and more efficient vehicles, and the ongoing transition to electrification. As Vivid will highlight, improving our cash flow performance is a priority for us."
0,"As I said a moment ago, we still expect our leverage ratio to reach 3. 5 times, so the extra cash just allows us to move a bit faster than we would have previously. One other change in our model, we originally guided a share count of 58 million to 59 million shares."
0,"As industry activity has increased, we have seen the benefits of cost reduction efforts taken during the downturn take hold and have seen strong incremental margin performance as a result. We continue to have a capital structure that allows us to defend against the volatility of our industry, while deploying additional capital toward attractive product development opportunities. We're maintaining our quarterly dividend at CAD 0."
0,"As I've said in my preamble, we've always said the Australian market is mature. This strategy of brand combination allows us to get in front of that and continue to drive margin and expansion as we have done, the generations at Spruson & Ferguson, and then more recently in the form of IPH. So, with that, that's my introduction."
0,"As James remarked, bolt-on M&A will be an important element of the strategy going forward, but with clear performance accountability. Given the flexibility provided by tax reform, which will allow us to more easily repatriate cash and better manage our gross debt levels, we are updating our position from Investor Day on share repurchase. While we still intend to at least cover equity dilution at times, if we have excess cash, we could use that cash to buy back shares above just covering our dilutions."
0,"As Peter noted, we are very pleased with the fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, and particularly with regard to the sixth consecutive quarter of organic growth, which coupled with our pricing and optimization activities, including SG&A leverage, allowed us to reach the high end of our guidance despite the headwinds our industry faced from last year and what we expect to be transitory raw material price inflation. What we call our self-renewing business model allows us to improve operating leverage, while continuing to grow revenue, and we believe our strategy will allow us to continue to fund reinvestment in our core business growth areas and strategic acquisitions to achieve our Vision 2020 targets. In my comments this morning, I'll review one-time adjustments for the fourth quarter of 2017 and provide an overview of the SG&A expenses, other income and expense lines and income tax expense."
0,"As Rob mentioned, we're pleased that our board of directors authorized an additional $3 billion for share repurchases, which we expect to utilize over the next several years. Our significant capital allocation flexibility allows us to continue to invest in our business, and return cash to shareholders while remaining committed to our 3. 5 times leverage target."
0,"As the market turned down in 2014, they participated in that, but more so on the project side of their business than the MRO aftermarket side of their business. So they've had very good market-type performance as we look back, nice job in working their margins, and we feel confident of that continuing going forward."
0,"As to moving the product closer to market, let me start with the announcement on just this last Monday regarding the FDA PDUFA fee waiver approval. The waiver allows us to avoid approximately $2. 4 million fees for our new drug application and enables us to continue focus our resources on finalizing the NDA."
0,"As to the capital sources necessary to fund the acquisitions activity, it is assumed to be funded with the combination of debt on the credit facility and net cash generated from operations. The level of assumed acquisition activity allows us to stay within the higher end of our targeted leverage range of 45%. Interest expense estimates on floating rate debt assumes that LIBOR rises steadily to approximately 2."
0,"As we all know and as we often say, logistics isn't a nice to have, it's a must have. It's what allows us to efficiently and reliably deliver our sand including the types, diversity and mesh mixes where and when it's required. The industry is seeing entrance by new companies with aspirations to develop production-only businesses with limited to nonexistent logistics capabilities."
0,"As we enter the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, and then return to the queue if you have additional follow-ups. This will allow us to address questions from as many participants as possible in the time that we have this morning. Yolanda, we're now ready to open the call for questions."
0,"As we head into our company's fourth year, we're a stronger organization across the board. Instead of starting the year with the one, we have 18 operators in a relatively small size still allows us to move the needle. Speaking of moving the needle, Mark will now discuss the acquisitions market and our pipeline."
0,"As we look at ensuring that we're investing at an appropriate level to continue to grow the business, we look at delivery of margin to the bottom line, we think that this is the right balance. And we think it's the right balance that allows us to manage the business effectively not only for 2018, but into the future. So, that was ultimately a call that Lance and I made relative to the margin."
0,"As we move forward in 2018, we remain focused on our goal to manage cost and productivity to hold the line on adjusted EBITDA margins. This allows us to maintain our position as the industry's high-quality, low-cost producer and continue generating consistent earnings and strong free cash flow. And with that, I'd now like to turn the call back to our operator who will facilitate taking your questions."
0,"As we've seen on accident benefits, bodily injury, the claims guys have done a phenomenal job at tempering inflation there. We feel confident that they can do the same from a PD standpoint. Secondly, the other risk is around regulatory risk, political intervention."
0,"As we've talked about in earlier calls, we changed our incentive plans to reflect that. So we're very confident that strong free cash flow and our balance sheet allows us to achieve both of the objectives you stated. So we don't see our improved dividend in any way impacting our ability to execute M&A if and when it becomes available to us."
0,"As you can see on this slide, our balance sheet continues to build strength on strength evidenced by one of the strongest credit ratings amongst their senior peers. We are exiting an intensive capital investment period and we're going to one that allows us to harvest on that investment. Our net debt to EBITDA is on a steep downward trend as you can see in this chart."
0,"As you can see our availability is 99. 9% in BDTCL and 100% in JTCL on the quarter three, which allows us to capture maximum incentives for this financial year or this period and we continue to focus on strong operating performance for quarter four as well. On page number 17, we have given a waterfall diagram of how our net distributable cash flow is computed at a consolidated level, which we have started with the EBITDA of INR 117."
0,"As you know, we didn't cut our dividend during the great financial crisis or thereafter. When evaluating the dividend, we balance our needs for capital reinvestment in the portfolio and our taxable income levels and we feel confident the increased dividend in 2018 won't diminish our coverage ratios. As a reminder, this increase follows on the heels of our 3."
0,"As you may recall, when we bought GH, we financed it with European debt. We're going to have to continue to do that and the markets will allow us to do that. So, this just draws what I'd say a short term wrinkle into our effective tax rate, but we're working hard to bring that back into line with where we would expect it to be in the high 20% type range."
0,"At Creston Mascota, it's almost the same where we have   as we mentioned, a year or so tied up some ground that was held by a rancher. That allows us to bring the Bravo area into production. We acquired Madrono from the same family that we acquired our work with on Pinos Altos."
0,"At Diplomat we've rolled out enhanced programs, which make sure patients and physicians are confident with the new treatment and the side effects, saving up to 50% of the cost for patients and payors on these initial fills. Having a model aligned to patients and payor savings versus pushing for unnecessary utilization or backend hidden rebating allows us to keep our model aligned with our clients' interests. Turning to our infusion solutions; we have continued to see a strong demand with patients and payors who are looking to have specialty infusion done in a lower cost home setting rather than hospitals or clinics and realizing the savings of this more effective delivery model."
0,"At the same time we will continue to grow ours. So while the gap may narrow we intend to maintain a gap, and that's what I think will allow us to be successful maintaining and growing market share in there. Now, if the gap completely closes and they can do everything that Amkor can do, the local customers are likely to use the local OSATs."
0,"banking industry. A highly differentiated level of client satisfaction produces a more stable client base, and allows us to do more with our existing clients. It also leads to strong word-of-mouth referrals."
0,"based companies with Follow the Sun type of agent populations around the world. And again, being in the cloud allows us to easily deploy highly distributed workforces around the world, especially with things like Global Voice that I just talked about."
0,"Because of the fact that we are inside the prostate, our surgeons are basically able to ablate the   in layman's terms I kind of call it the upper half of the prostate in the relevant zone. And that allows us to be very confident that the ejaculatory ducts that are under   in the lower half of the prostate are safe, that the nerve bundles that are below the prostrate are safe, that we're really away from the rectum, certainly, the urinary pathway is safe because of water. So, the likelihood of side effects is even lower of having any problems are much lower."
0,"Because our product   our product is localized and it's initially built for Russian users. Yes, and of course also the big data we have inside of our company allows us to make very good recommendations both for loyal users as well as for like cold start users."
0,"Before I turn it over to Steve, I'd like to thank our crewmembers for their hard work during 2017. This was an operationally challenging year, but I believe that our culture continues to be the secret sauce that allows us to rise to challenges and to provide our customers with the service they want and deserve. Steve, over to you."
0,"Beforehand, I'd like to ask that you kindly limit yourself to one question with one short follow-up, if necessary. This will allow us to get as many callers as possible. Now, operator, could we have your final instructions and the first questions, please?"
0,"Both were approximately 2% for the year, which is not the level we would have liked to have seen. We believe the economy in 2018 will allow us to grow and expect mid to high-single-digit growth in loans and deposits. Chris will cover our business development efforts more in a moment."
0,"Boulougouris. The trend so far in 2018 is very positive, around 6% growth in the group's figures in terms of sales, and we feel that gradually recovery in consumption is coming back and we feel confident that at least the like-for-like growth, which is every year 5% to 6%, is present this year. We target   the initial budget is saying that we target better growth than that."
0,"Broadly yes, but I must also add that we also buy coal locally in India and that also helps us manage our coal cost. Because we have extra washing capacity in India, so that allows us to buy some coking coal from the market and wash it and use it, so that also helps in reducing the cost, particularly when the international coal prices are going up. So, it's a combination of all this."
0,"But as far as the consumer is concerned, you see that very, very large marketplaces are out there, who have taken a lead on that and they continuously keep on investing and reporting losses. So that thesis, we've decided we will never take, we want to actually grow a business which allows us to monetize on the consumer. Now, in that, what we have done is, in Q3, of course, because of the festival season, that many of the branded products which become the head as well were essentially getting run through our system."
0,"But as far as us mobilizing and things, it's not a permanent issue more so it's just making sure that we do mobilize and nothing else comes up on those larger projects. We feel confident that they'll all go. We're not concerned at this point with that."
0,"But as far as us mobilizing and things, it's not a permit issue, more so it's just making sure that we do mobilize and nothing else comes up on those larger projects. We feel confident that they'll all go. We're not concerned at this point with that."
0,"But at the same time, we do not want to stop our consumers from buying ULIP because that's   as that's the product they want to buy from us. So we are working very hard in terms of reducing the ULIP share, but at the same time, the balance in our business across various channels and across various products allows us to continue deliver this margin. And we obviously remain confident that this kind of margin is sustainable going forward in the future."
0,"But because we are developing in the market that we are, this is a developing market, the risks are high, generally high, and if something does crop up, again we don't expect anything to, but we have the policy on provisioning conservative enough and that very cost of risk of RUB 1. 3 million that we have mentioned allows us to look with confidence at any black swans that might crop up."
0,"But I just want to say in any given year, there's going to be slightly different dynamics. There might be a year, what we have a pricing move and a certain part of our business that allows us to catalyze some growth and that kind of drives us up to the top. It could be that within Market Tech for instance, it takes a little while for us to build on the momentum that Nasdaq Financial Framework builds for us, but we already have been delivering 9%."
0,"But I think just on the comment on generics, we're really seeing a very similar trend in the marketplace, so we're seeing deflation. Obviously, the market's a bit consolidated, and we feel good about the work of our colleagues in Walgreens Boots Alliance development, and we feel confident we work with manufacturers in a very consistent way and over time. So, no change."
0,"But I think there's a propensity to over-dividend in the market. But what I'd rather do is ensure that we got a strong balance sheet, which allows us to bid for the right source of infrastructure jobs into the future."
0,"But if market condition changes, I do expect some rebalancing of those revenues. In general, we are very happy with the discipline and the capital consumption of our Investment Bank that allows us to basically every quarter to pay for its cost of capital, and in normal and good quarters to give a lot of benefit. But the most important also from a strategic standpoint of view value of our Investment Bank is the fact that we would not be the leading wealth manager in the world with CHF 1 trillion of share of wallet in ultra-high net worth and GFOs if we wouldn't be able to interact between   this interaction between our Family Offices and ultra clients and our Investment Bank."
0,"But in TV, this is a real step forward for us. This type of data allows us to do things, like look at a frequency versus response rate curve in TV. And frequency, let me just explain real quick, that's not how many accidents you get into in a given year."
0,"But it also points to, hey we haven't lost market share if you're growing for three quarters in a row and then to have one quarter slip back. So, I think there's as Jim pointed out in his prepared remarks, there is a delay or a push out or however you want to categorize it of business that we feel confident and encouraged that we will pick up over the next 2018 time period. We've done a pretty good detailed analysis of it."
0,"But it didn't happen until late in the quarter but   or early in this current year, but it should bode well for the upcoming year. So, that's just one example of a good exit point that allows us to hold to our previous expectation. We should be back to 42% to 43% as we exit Q2."
0,"But it remains to be seen. But we are   then, I think, the thing we can say is that we feel confident about the process."
0,"But looking at the third party distribution, we'd anticipate certainly some slight cost increases starting in the second quarter and then probably tricking in through the back half of the year. We'll pass those through as their competitive landscape allows us to. And so -- and all of that was reflected in our guidance that we gave you guys today."
0,"But looking at the third-party distribution, we'd anticipate certainly to see some slight cost   Atlantic cost increases starting in the second quarter and then probably trickling into the back half of the year. We'll pass those through as the competitive landscape allows us to. And all of that was reflected in our guidance that we gave you guys today."
0,"But obviously, when they choose to refinance based on the seasoning in this portfolio, most of them are long past call protections. It's really their call when they want to do something and it's obviously our hope that when they do, our incumbency with those borrowers allows us to do it with them, right? So, that's the key, but it's a good question."
0,"But one step at a time. 2018 is a year in which we finish Capsella, get this foundation locked-in in a way that will allow us to catapult into 2019 very strongly."
0,"But over the next few years, there's no reason to think that the Middle and Lower Spraberry and the Jo Mill in combination, referred to as the Spraberry zones, wouldn't be a significant contributor to our growth. But we want to make sure we do the proper work in terms of sequencing and stacking, spacing, and so on that allows us to have confidence that we're optimizing the development of those. So that's in fact exactly what we're doing right now."
0,"But over these recent years, we've built up a nice network, global network of both sites, countries and included more than 100 patients in our study. So we feel confident as well that we will be finding the patients and the centers and to execute the plan, as we have laid out before. So, for the first study that we'll read out is the PELICAN study, I'll come back to that study later, but so the second triple study which will start is in fact the GLPG2451, GLPG2222, GLPG2737 study, so we have also named the FALCON study."
0,"But overall, we're out to drive total revenue. I think we feel confident about that plan in general."
0,"But predominantly, those were sick retailers that basically had a lot of debt on them. And we feel confident that the industry is in much, much better shape today than it's ever been before. Most retailers have announced strong Q4, and their inventory position is better than it's ever been before."
0,"But that pressure is off because when SJM and MGM opened, that's pretty much the story. The normal increase in the growth of the tables will allow us to have as much equipment as we need. Remember, I also told in 2016 that we had enough equipment to make the money we needed."
0,"But that will trend down over time, as MiPlan becomes a more material component of the book. And that's why the investments in the cost base and making sure that we have a scalable lower marginal cost base going forward is incredibly important and will allow us to maintain operating margins albeit the average income per case will trend down over time, but the mix in the books change."
0,But the key is that we can fit their need and meet their strategy. We do have customers who specifically want product manufactured in a specific geography and we have the footprint that allows us to serve them.
0,"But the majority of the revenue and assumptions are based on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. I think in terms of JCAR017 specifically, I think we continue to believe that having a best-in-class profile will allow us to have significant market share in the space."
0,"But the second goal of payers is reducing overall healthcare costs. And we think that this acquisition will enable capabilities that will allow us to bring even more programs to the marketplace that meet the goal of payers, whether they be employers or health plans."
0,"But then on a cash basis between all the things, it probably is a $50 million cash benefit for us relative to some of those headwinds we're starting to face. So, that allows us to have a little extra cash to put to work."
0,"But there's also some investments in some accelerated capabilities. The foundation we now have allows us to build some new capabilities. And so, we've got a number of initiatives underway currently which are looking to exploit that."
0,"But this   every market downturn regardless of the cause seems like it's never happened before, or it's only going to get worse. Once again, we feel confident that we'll be able to replace the short-term deals with longer-term deals when they expire. But our strategy which you should understand completely is that over time, maintaining a higher occupancy in these assets leads to higher return and higher rents."
0,"But this is something, over the last six months, we've been working hard, and wanted to get to a point where we truly have confidence over the work that's been done. There are potential alternatives that allows us to be able to create more shareholder value, and that's what we're going to pursue. And there's a lot more to be done, and until such time that we're at a point of a decision, then at that point, we'll communicate more relative to the fundamental."
0,"But those aren't part of our permanent sell down program. The point of our asset recycling is not to reduce the size of our real estate portfolio, but rather to free up capital that allows us to make new investments in markets where the Hyatt brand, either isn't represented at all or underrepresented. So, that is something that we've successfully done over the years as a means of growing our portfolio."
0,"But two-thirds of our work is out of our corporate offices. So we have offices in several   you saw the geographic chart, several in the beltway, we have a presence in Ypsilanti, Michigan, Colorado, Florida, so it allows us to tap into that talent around the world. One thing we've seen is that as there is more demand for leveraging commercial innovation, so open-source software as well as non-traditional data sources, we're able to tap into those sources and use that as a way to build a pool of talent and then over time, we get their clearances picked up."
0,"But we are confident that the CHF 60,000 per quarter are okay if we look at the customer base, if you look also at the voice-only customers which over time disappear. So today, we feel confident with this CHF 60 million. And on the cost side, why I came to the conclusion to increase the cost target."
0,"But we feel pretty good then about our secular drivers. And our focus on cost reduction initiatives, that will allow us to achieve the goal for our target modeling."
0,"But we think this could take time to materialize. We feel confident in our ability to mitigate the impact of our future increases in cost of steel through price increases, but that could take some time. I also talked about our Eighty-Twenty Improvement program."
0,"But we're seeing the productivity for the sales guys, relatively staying the same, a little up from what we were seeing before on an average basis. Just more capacity really allows us to get   get too much of the market."
0,"But what is unique is our ability to re-engineer the menu. So we're not hostage to any one or two particular commodities or categories, where we can re-engineer   unlike a lot of food companies, we can re-engineer that center of plate menu that allows us to deal with inflationary pressure. So I think the combination of all of that gives both Steve and I a high degree of confidence that we can manage through almost any type of inflationary environment pretty effectively."
0,"But, Matt, we have a talented team in place in these areas. With one more year of experience, we feel confident we have the right strategies in place to have a successful 2018."
0,"But, you're absolutely right. The ability to use a digital channel, a very sort of close-looped channel allows us to introduce the brands to the guests at the value end of our spectrum. And just like they do in normal new markets, they start to explore the menu and sort of migrate up into other items on the menu."
0,"By comparison, our traditional C&I and commercial finance loans have a weighted average yield excluding accretion income of approximately 470 basis points. That is why our strategy of rebalancing our loan portfolio by replacing residential mortgages and multi-family loans with diversified commercial loans is so important, as this will allow us to offset lost accretion income and increase our core loan yields and NIM. In the fourth quarter, we grew traditional C&I and commercial finance loans by $368 million, while multi-family loans were stable and residential mortgage loans decreased by $227 million."
0,"By creating this structure backed by long-term contracts, we're able to provide clients with the depth, flexibility and specialized knowledge necessary to drive optimal insights and business outcomes. In short, it allows us to act as an extension of the client's enterprise. In the past, we have mentioned our dedicated analytics centers for QBE Insurance and GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals."
0,"By taking these costs out, we were able to absorb AUD 39 million of new costs arising from wage growth and inflation, investments in new capabilities and customer experiences, and expansion of our key growth businesses. This strategy to have a savings where we can, plus reinvest where we need to, will allow us to contain controllable costs going forward whilst growing the top line. On an annualized run rate basis, savings achieved in 2017 are in the order of 10% of the normalized 2016 cost base, excluding AMP Capital."
0,"Can I complement you sort of   just to be clear in your question, the dollar per barrel that is coming from the projects that we are implementing today and that should be fully here in 2020 will allow us to have an increasing in our refining margin premium. So this is over a benchmark of about $1 per barrel."
0,"Can I complement, Filipe? Just to be clear in your question, the dollar per barrel that is coming from the projects that we are implementing today and that should be fully here in 2020 will allow us to have an increasing in our refining margin premium.

0,"Cash used by operations during 2017 was $37,000 compared to $346,000 used by operations in the prior year primarily due to timing of receivables, reduction of inventory levels, offset by our increased loss. We have a loan facility available for our working capital needs, which allows us to borrow up to approximately $3. 2 million."
0,"cash, that's my international cash and I can't touch my international cash   excuse me   in the same manner. So it's actually nice to see that we won't have the overall trapped cash, but it still allows us to focus on what our key uses of cash are. Our number one use of cash is investment back into the business."

So, that allows us to do a nice bolt-on, we get a great return, it extends your product line as well as brings in a new product to you. And I will look for those any day of the week."
0,"Credit loss provisioning in the year was at a cyclical low, and we did not see the level of litigation and regulatory settlement expense that has been a hallmark of recent prior years. Our balance sheet and our cash position are in great shape, which allows us to continue our modernization efforts from a strong financial foundation. What is not acceptable is our profit and loss account, and this will be our determined focus for 2018 and beyond."
0,"Customer and partner interest in the Workday Cloud Platform continues to grow and we are pleased with the initial results and feedback from our early adopter program. Switching to the people front, a key part of our success continues to be our vibrant company culture, which allows us to maintain high levels of employee satisfaction and greatly helps us attract and retain talent across all levels of the company. To that end, we are proud of our recent recognition as number seven on the list of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For in the U."
0,"Dave, if I was to add I think our partner has some sophisticated tools that they use to help them assess their sales force and they're sharing all those tools with us. So we feel confident that we'll have incremental data sources to have a good understanding of where we're having success in the markets. But a lot of those details we won't be sharing with you."

And with our 650 folks across the world in every single industry and asset class looking for deals, it's basically, we're   it's the platform approach which allows us to day in and day out have what we see right now, a fairly robust pipeline of deals. Now, the other thing I'd point out is it's not   and I know your question was Private Equity oriented, but it's just broader than Private Equity."
0,"Deleverage and growth, we feel that the cash flow profile supports that. This strong balance sheet and the compelling cash flow profile allows us to take a look at the combined and quite attractive pipeline of strategic growth capital projects that have been already identified. We think these growth capital projects can be self-funded from internally generated cash flows."
0,"De-risking is a hot topic still. For 2018, we don't expect to see an economic environment that will allow us to help clients with lots of book lump sum offers. But we do expect a good environment for annuity purchases."
0,"Design to Value helps us to understand in detail the attributes of our products that are most important for the consumer and those are, in fact, less relevant. It then moves to the end-to-end supply chain costs from raw materials to distribution and allows us to take cost out without affecting and indeed sometimes even improving the consumer experience along the way. 5-S is very fact based."
0,"Despite the different weather-related challenges we experienced during the year, we were able to deliver good results and generate attractive cash flows. From an operational standpoint, we had an excellent performance in all our business, supported by a very well-executed commercial strategy which allows us to mitigate the effects of the adverse weather scenarios. Let me insist, this is a result of our disciplined focus on maintaining our costs low."
0,"Despite the margin improvements in the second half of last year, the Patient Experience business was historically challenged to deliver the growth and profitability of our other two business segments. The divesture allows us to focus our capital and our development resources on our higher margin business segments and products. On February 12, therefore, we divested our Patient Experience business to Press Ganey Associates for $65."

This payment allows us to optimize our income tax expense. The before mentioned sale of Dufry America Inc."
0,"During 2017, in addition to the two successful public share offering, we completed one convertible debenture issue, and we increased our credit facility to CAD 210 million with a syndicate of four Canadian banks in order to support the continued growth of our mortgage portfolio. This allows us to carefully grow our mortgage book, while maintaining a debt to assets ratio of under 50%. In summary, we have had another excellent record year and are positioned to continue to grow."
0,"During 2017, we generated strong cash flows from operations of $135 million. This allows us to rapidly repay debt as we go forward. We ended the year with $654 million of net debt, which represents approximately 3."

Additionally, we are shifting away from a one-size-fits-all marketing philosophy."

Where we compete, we are very good, which allows us to be discriminating and to generate very, very, very attractive return on the margin and unit of capital at this point. So, no, we don't see it as a constraint."
0,"Every technology change that we've gone through, we typically   we do over two, three or four years. It allows us to manage the projects better, control quality, capture the learnings that this whole industry has every time you put in a new technology, and gives us the advantage of declining costs out of the manufacturers. I don't see that changing."
0,"Every time they ask me things about perspectives going forward, given the good results that we had, our goal is always to maintain that which we are delivering. So for me to be able to say this, the EBITDA margin is what allows us to have this positive results. With our construction, 65% EBITDA margin is very positive."
0,"Everything's in parallel, so we're moving ahead, designing the Phase 3 and having those discussions with the FDA with the assumption that we have no better knowledge of the efficacy than we do today. If that changes, we do generate efficacy data then of course that will allow us to redesign the Phase 3."
0,"Example, High Performance Compute, Hyper Converged, Synergy, which has been a great success for us, but remember, it plays two roles.

0,"Fed tends to be somewhere between 10% and 15% of our business, and so, really, the success of our overall business is going to come from all these multiple growth drivers. And each one varies from quarter-to-quarter, but the nice thing about our business is that we've got a balanced portfolio that allows us to tap into the various growth drivers."
0,"Few years ago we were running in the low teens. Now, we're below 10%, and again our idea is to be able to continue to drive that as a percentage of sales lower, which will allow us to expand our margins and allow us to continue to produce free cash flow. So with that I'm going to turn the talk back over to Eric."
0,"Fewer and fewer and fewer people used over time. And this allows us to give us good gross margins, this allows us to curate data accurately and reproducibly. None of those competitors have anything on the backend for curating data."

We've got the sustainable business model that allows us to have a regular return of cash to the investors, comes in two forms. The dividend targeted at 30% to 40% of adjusted net income is going to continue to grow, that's going to grow with the growth of net income."
0,"First is the passion for Paint. By being a focused Paints and Coatings company, it allows us to shamelessly focus on Paints and Coatings. It sound trivial."
0,"First of all, we start with $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet. We do that because we believe our investors want us to be exposed to commodity prices, aluminum, alumina and bauxite, and therefore having cash on the balance sheet allows us to react when times turn tough very quickly. It also helps us to whether some seasonality where we have cash drops at the beginning of the year."
0,"First, as I said, we do have a buyback plans that we are utilizing and we'll continue to utilize. One other key factor here is the recent tax reform allows us to   so we are still looking into it, but it should allow us to utilize and to repatriate part of forecast.

This allows us to sell custom power wheelchairs without restrictions from our Taylor Street manufacturing facility. Since this restriction was lifted on July 24, 2017, we've been actively re-familiarizing our customers with our Invacare TDX line Power Wheelchair."
0,"For 2018, we are currently expecting an adjusted EBIT slightly below last year. While we feel confident to offset a significant part of the expected fuel cost increase of â‚¬700 million, it would be imprudent at this stage to assume we would be able to fully recover this. Our guidance on operating KPIs remains unchanged from what we have published in January."

0,"For more comprehensive presentation on the TRiM platform, you can view the webcast recording of an R&D day that we hosted in September 2017, which can be found on the Investors section of the Arrowhead website. One significant benefit of the TRiM platform is that it allows us to move very fast from an idea to an optimized clinical candidate as demonstrated by the speed at which we were able to advance our two lead candidates; ARO-AAT is our second generation subcutaneously administered candidate for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency liver disease, and ARO-HBV is our third generation subcutaneously administered clinical candidate for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. We went from restarting our preclinical models and designing new triggers at the end of 2016 to selecting final candidates, manufacturing drug supply, completing GLP tox studies and filing CTAs just 12 months later."
0,"For starters, we're well-positioned for return to normal operations in East Texas and Louisiana markets, after last year's record weather disruptions. Importantly, our delivered wood model allows us to be proactive.

0,"For the first quarter, we expect total LOE to range from $74 million to $89 million, and for full year 2018, we expect it to range between $293 million to $328 million. Now keeping that in mind, the midpoint of this range our total LOE expenses are trending down from the full year 2017, but this guidance range allows us to spend prudently throughout this year on maintenance and repairs of our infrastructure, which is intended to improve production downtime. Pipeline Facility Fee expense was $10."
0,"For the full-year of 2017, we generated positive operating cash flow of approximately $40 million, largely a result of a reduction in working capital levels. We remain highly focused on maintaining strong cash generation through disciplined cost and working capital management, which will allow us to better ride out the remainder of the cyclical downturn, support our operational excellence program and continue to allow the flexibility to invest as we deem appropriate. Capital spending for the fourth quarter of 2017 was approximately $350,000, while our full-year 2017 total capital expenditures were approximately $1 million."

0,"Fulfillment remained strong at 18% year-over-year growth, driven by strong demand for our cloud solutions despite lower enablement activity. In 2017, we rolled out the next generation of our web fulfillment product to our customers, which moves beyond traditional EDI and allows us to develop more strategic, consultative relationships with our customers by enhancing their ability to consult with SPS directly through the interface to address the needs of their trading partners. In the fourth quarter, we engaged with Mills Fleet Farm, an Upper Midwest retailer since 1955, with a diversified offering of merchandise of over 120,000 SKUs across a broad range of product categories."

And so, we took it upon ourselves to invest in technology that allows us to dispatch our mill system in an extremely efficient way. And we've been able to use that to pro forma the KapStone mill system."
0,"Given our high level of capital generation, the group has decided to raise its payout ratio for 2018 to 40% to 50% versus the previously guided level of 35% to 40%. This is a level that we believe allows us to maintain a high level of growth without significantly impacting our equity to total assets ratio. And that concludes the presentation."

But I also, of course as normally, invite the people attending on the telephone conference to participate in the Q&A session."
0,"Here I'll touch on some of the operational elements. Certainly our industry scale, both from a portfolio perspective as well as the strength that exists within our supply chain, allows us to serve concurrently the largest operators around the world, so certainly no small feat. Our portfolio is complemented very nicely by global services capability that Dan touched on that allows us to work closely with our customers to deploy our products, enabling them to go have some level of backwards compatibility for all the devices that are deployed in the network today while deploying new technologies."
0,"How the business will pan out? So I would say that looking at how we have progressed from December 2014 to December 2017, despite whatever happened in between, we feel confident that in three to three-and-a-half years, we should be double or close to double of the loan book without changing the mix of this portfolio."
0,"However to summarize, first, it's all about bringing real, global scale to our portfolio. Second, this allows us to complete our platform, be it on a customer, product or geographic basis. Third, we'll be leading in electrified mobility propulsion systems."
0,"However, the progress we made on our strategic initiatives, enabled us to deliver improved performance in the second half of 2017 and emerges one of the strongest players in the global glassware and housewares industries. We feel confident in our ability to deliver improved financial performance in the coming year. We expect similar global economic conditions to 2017, and we believe our industry and competitive trends will improve, but remain challenged."
0,"However, under the new revenue pronouncement ASC 606, we will estimate the collectability of all tests going through insurance and we will record these revenues on an accrual method starting January 1. This will allow us to recognize revenue on carrier test before we collect from insurance. Looking at the fourth quarter, if we had accounted for revenue under the new ASC 606 standard, we estimate that we would have recognized incremental hundreds of thousands of additional dollars in revenue during the quarter."
0,"However, we do not actively monitor how many patients ultimately choose a port for drug delivery. We feel confident that approximately 40% to 50% of all new patients starting EXONDYS 51 will opt for a port. A significant measure of progress is that during the first year of launch, 100% of the top Tier 1 and Tier 2 treatment centers prescribed EXONDYS 51."
0,"I am Murat Ã–zgÃ¼l, CEO of Genel Energy, and would like to welcome you to our 2017 Full Year Results Presentation. It has been a fantastic year for Genel, and there are significant opportunities ahead. Today, I'm joined by Esa, our Chief Financial Officer, and Bill, our Chief Operating Officer."
0,I do think first mover is very important with this area because it allows us to develop this rapport and relationship with the different cancer centers. And so I think a first mover advantage is important in this area.
0,"I don't think there's anything different. I mean, we are   we made good returns in that business and we know what we're doing in that business and we have access to a resource that allows us to produce oil at very attractive returns and so we're continuing to do it. We continue to like that business and like the returns and the investment we get, and we've think we've got a good team there."
0,"I just got the   we have five minutes left notification, so I'll jump into the next two strategies. Cash generation, we have an industry-leading financial profile that allows us to generate earnings and cash flow to invest in brand-building and also pay down our debt to give us capital available to be deployed. We've got best-in-class free cash flow conversion, over 150%."
0,"I know that probably what you're looking for is what is the net impact on the acquisitions to the whole, but that becomes that net impact between the two. The important thing that we feel we want folks to focus on is that organic EBITDA margin, which we feel confident, will expand in 2018."
0,"I mean, I think I made this comment last quarter that we don't feel the need to go chasing market share. We feel confident that we have the options now, that we have this stronger write-to-win, that we can participate accordingly and feel confident with what that would yield for us and namely for our shareholders. So, the portfolio diversification, the focus that we have on Vehicular now so we can make good global decisions has us very well positioned to, let's say, engage appropriately with those new market dynamics you described."
0,"I mean, it's hard to have a community presence and brand recognition overnight in the middle market space and in the consumer space and that's our bread and butter. So, we've been doing that for decades, successfully, and we feel confident in our ability to continue to do so notwithstanding the recent news of new entrants."
0,"I mean, there's always people trying to nip at our heels for this business, but we have strong relationships with the big builders. And maybe even beyond strong relationships is our North America-wide company-owned distribution footprint allows us to provide the same level of service and quality and relationships for national builders everywhere and they value that and our ability to deliver to them."
0,"I mean, there's always risk in this business, we do have to replace some of the Event Business that was strong last year. We feel confident we're going to be able to do that. We saw good trends in the Base Business."
0,I think an ATM is perhaps not as applicable to larger transactions. And we right now have a pretty decent cash balance that allows us to really pursue the bolt-on transactions without that.
0,"I think it adds modularized design and process elements, they can be thoroughly developed, validated and replicated to build the scale and to assure quality and consistency. Digital Trace allows us to connect our distributed manufacturing processes as nodes on the network. Digital Trace defines common architecture, provides a real-time view of manufacturing efficiency, local improvements can be rapidly shared across the network, tracking of individual assembly becomes part number specific, data set includes process performance, all relevant local databases are linked."
0,"I think it should be possible, because some of our business will allow us to collect money quickly as compared to the other ones, but again Q3 is not the true representative because they are carrying a very large inventory of pipes, which were manufactured for our customers and they could not get the clearance from their respected   ultimate customer, that's the government department, therefore we are straddled with unrealistic inventory. And secondly for the MOX films we are in the off season right now..."
0,"I think it's also important to note that at an overall level, we have 25 manufacturing facilities in the UK zone and we have 25 facilities in the rest of Europe. So, we feel quite balanced in terms of our manufacturing footprint and we feel confident about our strategies with respect to dealing with any fall out of Brexit or anything like that. And Brian touched on some specific Brexit mitigation strategies that we have."
0,"I think it's fair to say you can expect we're in conversations with all three of those to replicate the experience into a multi-year scenario. We feel like in our conversations with our clients, it really represents not only the best interests of ServiceSource, but for them as well as it allows us to do longer-term planning as it relates to resources and investments we make in the relationship."
0,"I think it's the new normal for a short number of years, Michael. We are confident that in the longer term, the strategy of the business will allow us to get back to a point where we publicly traded over the last five years. But certainly, right at this point in time, we know that we need to invest."
0,I think that adding the other indications will allow us to progress rapidly to a recommended Phase 2 dose. I think that was a motivation behind that.
0,"I think that the manufacturing structure and partnerships we have on VCSELs today is extremely efficient and I would put our supply chain up against any vertically-integrated supplier today. As the edge-emitters I think is unique and that the process and technology that we have for edge-emitters allows us to hit higher volumes at, I think, pretty aggressive costs. So I think that the margin profile will be similar."
0,"I think the $20 million is a good bogey. And once we feel confident that the funnel is substantially higher than where it currently sits now and we feel good that we can take that up, we will, right? But we feel good about what we've been able to do this year."
0,"I think the key thing for our customers is to make sure that they have a consistently good experience and then part of our main drivers for adding even more spectrum to our existing footprint is to make sure that that consistency is all over the network today. And recently we developed a tool called Quality of Experience that actually allows us to tie a lot of the network key performance indicators to our customer experience. So, every one of our customer has a QoE score."
0,"I think there is a regulatory blueprint here as analogs with other agents, Keytruda and TRK mutations at all. But I think this one presents a significant opportunity in addition to MD Anderson's data on prevalence. We're also fielding some work internally to really understand the prevalence by tumor type across the board to gain a deeper insight into absolute market size."
0,"I think we're taking a wait and see position on volume over the rest of the year. We do feel that volume does couple great things for us, number one, just uses our fixed costs better, allows us to pass through pricing a little bit quicker which is valuable for us and then just with a higher sales. You know one point I want to make   I want to really emphasize here is that without the effects of a rising commodity and rising revenue based on us passing through the commodity, our margins for the first quarter would have been   in Electrical Raceway would have been 19% and would have been higher in the Mechanical Products and Solutions."
0,I think we've previously communicated that we need a minimum of 100 valuable patients based on our powering of the comparison to the MUD cohort and we feel confident we will hit that number.
0,"I think what we want to be careful of and we want to listen for is, if clients are having a poor experience converting, that's going to slow the entire conversion down. And so that's why you saw a big window between those first clients going live, and now, when we're going into our monthly conversions, making sure the clients have a really good experience, allows us to continue to increase the velocity through the year. And so, I think if you want to think it from a risk perspective, it's how happy are the clients that are going on as long as that's happening, I actually think that keeps bringing the risks down."
0,I think what we've done both with NTS and silicon photonics in our regular way of business in the beginning of the year allows us to reach this OpEx target.
0,"I think you saw us deliver on our objectives for this past year. I think at this point, we feel confident in the size of our balance sheet. You could see the capital ratios and leverage ratio in particular are at a nice place, which gives us the room we'd like."
0,"I think, that's a great point, Scott. The deal we did with Five Point allows us to what you say upsize our facilities with 260 million cubic feet a day in gas processing. I think, that leaves substantial room for third party."
0,"I think, there's more to come there. We think there's a lot that we can accomplish through automation, we've talked about hiring more people in other locations, which allows us to hire more quickly, more efficiently and retain those people at lower costs. And so I think those things will all benefit us down the road as well."
0,"I want to be clear, our intention is not to fully develop the PepperJack prospect ourselves. Our goal is to de-risk the process   the prospect to a level that will allow us to attract third-party development capital. We'd like to structure something that commits an operator to a relatively aggressive development pace, and we think the best way to secure this is by having at least two delineation wells, of which one we already have."
0,I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication during this very busy time of year. We continue to believe that focusing on employee satisfaction and engagement allows us to deliver both an industry-leading product and service experience to our clients. Part of our investments in our employees include modernization of our work environment.
0,"I want to thank, Jim, and we appreciate his outstanding service to the company, our employees, and our shareholders. Moving on, last quarter, we began our call by reviewing our diversified business model and how it contributes to the strength of our overall business and also allows us to proactively navigate the cyclical nature of the end markets we serve. The same is true in this quarter."
0,"I was saying that's   either there's seasonality in our business, of course, so, I mean, so the second quarter for us is a traditionally weak quarter both from an earnings standpoint and cash flow generation. But I would just say, Rosemarie, that we   when we meet our expectations on EBITDA, it will allow us to pay down significantly more debt than what we paid down in 2017."
0,"I would say that the underlying movement in crude and energy values, hurricanes, supply and demand in specific geographic areas that have either easier or harder competitive comps are all factors in that pricing environment. There is really not one factor that's out there, but as generally speaking, the industrial atmosphere in North America improved, that's where the majority of our exposure is, that's a backdrop that allows us to be more aggressive on our pricing actions."
0,"I would say that's pretty fair. And I think that we just feel in a good position where we've got strong offerings in both elements and allows us to get the right mix for our   any individual client. So, we really work with them to assess their needs, and if they need a hybrid approach, we can help them realign."
0,"I would say that's pretty fair. And I think that we just feel in a good position where we've got strong offerings in both elements and allows us to get the right mix for our individual client. So, we really work with them assess their needs, and if they need a hybrid approach, we can help them realign."
0,"I would say, first and foremost, the results of the data that we're generating with AAV9 in SMA, we're very pleased with, both in terms of the safety profile as well as the efficacy profile. What this allows us to do, though, is there may be, over the course of time, we may find there are certain subtypes of patients that we can't access with AAV9. As an example, we've highlighted that neutralizing antibodies are exceptionally rare in this group, but that could be something that we could look at addressing with a different serial type from the SMA NAV library at REGENXBIO."
0,"Identified initiatives include the netting of Tampa Electric storm restoration cost recovery against utilities estimated 2018 tax reform benefits once approved by the Florida Public Service Commission. The settlement filed with the FPSC includes two separate dockets which will allow us to true-up and recover any differences in 2019. Additionally, the impact to cash flow will be mitigated further in 2019 through the refund of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards."
0,"If all we're doing is trying to get bigger share of wallet or kind of keep the pipe about the same size, it's going to be tougher to put new products. But the hope is, as we widen the funnel, as we get our customer base broader and broader, it will allow us to bring additional products at additional price points into the pipe. That'll be the key."
0,"If L'OrÃ©al Luxe has managed to outperform the market again, it is thanks to the balance of its brand portfolio, which includes big major brands highly aspirational and multi-experts such as LancÃ´me, Yves Saint Laurent and Giorgio Armani, but also growth-relay brands that are often category specialists such as Urban Decay and Kiehl's and new gems that will become hopefully leading brands tomorrow. The richness of our portfolio allows us to meet the expectations of every consumer tribe at any price point. LancÃ´me, our number one brand worldwide, has recorded one of its best years ever with double-digit growth, proving its ability to reinvent itself, seducing millennials, and retaining baby boomers' loyalty."
0,"If we come out with compensation, maybe that adds gets us to 15, 000 or 20,000 and then all of a sudden we're in career and succession management and then we do onboard and recruiting and we just   with each new product we come out with I think we're going to be able to inch up the market. And by the way, we don't really have any interest in going down market except in the case of like our Paychex deal that we just announced on the Q4 call, that allows us to get to that lower part of the market through one channel vendor. We're fine with that."
0,"If we have enough of a resource base where we can have a sustainable production, because I don't think it makes sense also to run up to 6,000 tonnes for a short period of time. If we're going to build that capacity, we want to have a sustainable resource behind us that allows us to utilize it for a longer term. But along with Joe, we're out to make the   be the most effective asset we possibly can for Goldcorp."
0,"If you exclude the new theatres that I just referenced as well as two theatres that are no longer comparable to last year because their pricing policies were changed pretty significantly as a result of the new theatres that we opened nearby, fiscal 2017 fourth quarter box office receipts increased 6. 9% for comparable theatres and decreased 1% for those same comparable theatres for the full fiscal 2017, which then allows us to do a comparison to our results to the U. S."
0,"If you look at all of our businesses which have this 5% growth, if you look at what we then called the RONE, which is the notional equity, which is the metric we use pre-tax which we use for each of the businesses, you do see that they continue to be at the right level and have a good evolution. So from that point of view, we feel confident that the overall interface with the client is delivering the profitability as we set forth. That will be my answer to that."
0,"If you think about Next Gen, again, there we're not providing the TPA services. So it still allows us to participate in advanced payment model programs. And traditionally, UPMC has provided support on the Medicare Advantage side."
0,"I'll just say that given our experience in this space, we started working in this space about 2003, published the first paper in 2005. We feel confident that we've looked at antibodies that have lots of different ways of targeting alpha-synuclein that target different parts of the protein, that target different modifications of the protein, and we're pretty happy with how PRX002 acts across the entirety of the biology that we've been able to explore."
0,"I'm not forecasting a recession, I don't know when it's going to occur, but when that occurs, we want to outperform. And I think being overweight secured versus unsecured, being overweight Quebec and being very agile in capital markets will allow us to do that. And specifically for commercial banking, I will not chase volume and as a team, we will not chase volume and at the expense of good risk management and at the expense of NIMs, we've increased our volume."
0,"I'm trying to make sure our costs don't escalate. So I'm working those and that assessment to protect our costs and to maintain, you know, assure we have continuity of service and to integrate the right number of employees that will allow us to achieve that result. I'm looking at just not the size of Cominar today, but what Cominar may look like or be tomorrow."
0,"I'm very pleased that that will drive a couple million dollars of annual savings for several years going forward by pushing forward with that initiative. And the third is continued investment in a couple of areas, but the most notable being our central data management platform, Zero & One, which we rolled out internally about a year ago and are just really beginning to speak publicly about, but allows us to continue to progress in enabling all the agencies within MDC's portfolio to be at the forefront of leveraging data analytics on behalf of their clients."
0,"In 2017 we did over 25 discrete different procedures over in Europe. So it just shows the versatility of Senhance where our CE is a fairly broad CE mark   it's general surgery, GYN, neurology, and thoracic   so it allows us to experience a lot of different types of anatomy. And so I think when we continue to expand our indications, it really just allows more access to the market."
0,"In 2017, the full year participation rate amongst common shareholders was approximate 36% representing CAD 791 million of dividend reinvestment. In June of last year, we established an at-the-market or ATM program that allows us to issue up to CAD 1 billion in common shares from time-to-time, over a 25-month period at our discretion at the prevailing market price when sold in Canada or the United States. The use of the ATM will be shaped by our spend profile, as well as the availability and relative cost of other funding sources."
0,"In 2017, we announced a partnership with Viacom and AMC, which will produce original content for the Spectrum video platform before subsequent windowing. Working with our long-standing programming partners allows us to leverage their expertise in creating compelling original content, as well as to defray cost. We hired a seasoned original content executive to help us manage these partnerships and evaluate new ones with our existing programming partners."
0,"In addition, 2017 was notable for the traction we gained in our customized solutions. Our consulted advisory service that allows us to tailor an investment portfolio among proprietary and nonproprietary investments like ETFs to meet a client's specific investment objectives. In fact, our largest separate account closed in 2017, $150 million mandate was one because of this service, and we've also enhanced our relationships with several other clients by providing this solution as well."
0,"In addition, as we've discussed before, another way in which we manage risk from ongoing development is by substantially match funding long term capital with development underway. This allows us to lock in development profit and substantially reduce development funding risk. As you can see on slide 25, we were approximately 75% match-funded against development underway at year in 2017 consistent with our objective of being roughly 70% to 80% match-funded against this book of business."
0,"In addition, we receive a small equity component in the WHAM entity itself. By leveraging our OTT track record and expertise, we believe this type of deal will allow us to financially participate in a significant number of potentially profitable OTT channels with almost no financial risk. Our current three owned-and-operated OTT channels are now generating approximately $3."
0,"In addition, we received $401 million in non-binding tax equity term sheets for five additional tax equity partnerships. We estimate that these tax equity partnerships will allow us to install approximately 265 megawatts. We're in a transitional period, where we're shifting sales resources to acquire systems with a combination of better sun hours and PPA rates."
0,"In addition, we're focused on exploration at Shahuindo and at targeted locations in our Timmins operations. We're focused on making the most of these significant opportunities, and we'll continue developing our gold operations and demonstrating the value and upside potential that exist within our pipeline. Finally, I want to remind you that at the foundation of our business is an extraordinary workforce."
0,"In annual terms, for 2018 we expect similar levels of generation, those observed during the year 2017. Our units continue to show very good levels of availability, which are curving to the current remuneration scheme allows us to generate significant amount of revenues. During the fourth quarter 2017, the average availability factor of our thermal units was 92% compared to 80% in the fourth quarter of 2016."
0,"In fact, over 700 new deals came through our pipeline in 2017. Our sourcing capability allows us to be highly selective. In terms of diligence, we take a private equity approach to lending."
0,"In following year, we revised our sales and marketing strategy to encourage eye care specialists to write Avenova prescriptions to be filled through retail pharmacies. This strategy allows us to capitalize on insurance reimbursements which has successfully driven revenue growth and expanded gross margins. Now as you may know, through the prescription retail pharmacy channel, we offer rebates on Avenova pricing to patients with high co-pays or no insurance."
0,"In recent years, we've consistently increased our dividend and significantly grown our total payout to over $5 billion in 2017. Our non-objection from the 2017 CCAR submission allows us to return almost $7 billion in dividends and buybacks through 2Q 2018. The increase in capital return has been executed while we've concurrently invested for future growth and maintained adequate capital levels."
0,"In some ways you can think of this as bridge financing. It allows us to move right now on buybacks at what we believe is a favorable share price while waiting until we can begin generating proceeds from Yahoo Japan share sales and also evaluating further strategies for our Alibaba shares, which I'll turn to in a moment. Obviously, the authorization size is larger than the existing net cash position."
0,"In support of this ambition, we are consolidating our cigarette brand portfolio for the morphing of local brands into international trademarks. This consolidation is important, because it allows us to focus our innovation and more efficiently support the smaller number of brands with greater volume. It also removes complexity and thus cost from our production processes."
0,"In terms of emergency replacement, we still think we're very well-positioned. We think our PartsPlus stores, the fact that we own our own distribution, allows us to grow it. Also, when we talked about Commercial at the Analyst Day in December, we sort of broadened the definition of how we're thinking about it."
0,"In terms of innovation, just a couple of words about three initiatives that we've undertaken. We have today close to 90% of our Commercial Property Investment, which is monitored between energy consumption for tenants and compare it with a system that we call DEEPKI, and this allows us to really accelerate the control of our energy consumption and optimizing the tenants' consumption. We've also developed a system of MA SMART HOME or My Smart Home applications for 100% of the new properties that we're developing."
0,"In terms of your second question regarding outflows, firstly, to be very clear, actually, the change that we made in the pay grid, what that does is we actually pay our more productive FAs more. And, in fact, those pay grades are among the most attractive in the industry, and that allows us to focus on retention. And indeed, if you look at our attrition level, they've come down considerably year-on-year."
0,"Industrial will continue to grow in terms of   as we continue development one phase at a time. We feel confident of a lot of things. And then Calgary office will continue to decline, except that as I mentioned, it's small   It's not under 1% of our total portfolio in terms of GLA for the next several years."
0,"Industrial's 2017 performance reflects the dedication and the efforts of our management and associates over the past several years, and the completion of a number of projects that will enhance the customer experience as well as drive long-term cost efficiencies. First, we completed the conversion of our legacy warehouse management system, which facilitated better fulfillment and service levels throughout our network and will allow us to more efficiently support increased sales volume. Second, we have invested in IT and data tools for our sales organization to better target profile and service the almost 1,000 new business accounts that we generate every business day."
0,"It actually, as we foresee it based on those two factors, is relatively modest, but wouldn't be possible if we hadn't taken the cost out. That's the fundamentally important thing to understand that the flexibility that comes from having done that allows us to look at increasing investment, but we're not going to be doing things crazy. There's a smart way to do it."
0,"It adds medical waste, it enhances our resource recovery footprint. It is this suite which allows us to be confident on our synergy commitment. We have not taken into account any revenue of capital synergies as yet, which undoubtedly will be available, but it's always difficult to commit and deliver product where actual acquisition is taking place."
0,"It allows us to be more aggressive in portfolio management. It allows us to be more aggressive in accomplishing our goals of double-digit growth, gross margin over 50%, OpEx below 20% and operating margin above 30% and just continued free cash flow growth."
0,"It changed activity quite a bit, I mean it's a good question because there are more and more people   it allows us to have conversations at the scrub sink, it allows us to open up a dialogue more. We've got over 250 people who went to courses this year, which is up from about 200 or so last year."
0,"It could be governed under the confidentiality agreement, and I don't know, no one in the room here looks like they know that. So, we're going to respectfully not answer that question until we know whether the confidentiality agreement allows us to disclose that."
0,"It doesn't mean that we don't have good debates around different ideas and different things we're going to do. But at the end of the day, the trust level between us is enormous and it allows us to move faster."
0,"It has to be managed, is manageable. And I think that there will be significant opportunities for us. Israel; very good."
0,"It is a system of just short of 14 million tons. It is a system where because we have a technological advantage, it allows us to very quickly transfer best practices from one part of our   one set of our facilities to the rest of our facilities. We have over the course of the last five years."
0,It is our intention to maintain these efficiencies by meeting our goals of improving EBITDA margin by at least 200 basis points. Sound financial management by optimizing capital costs and taking advantage of current interest rates and a diversified financial structure will allow us to secure additional increases in target profits. All of these will contribute to a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 6% during this period as you've heard before.
0,"It makes it easier to cross-train, it makes it easier to move people across as you get changes in capacity. It allows us to deal with spikes in activity by having people that are cross-trained and move across functions fairly seamlessly because they don't have to get trained on a new platform. They know how it looks, they know how to log on, they know how to make it work, the job just comes to them, they process it, they move on to the next piece."
0,"It needs to go to 10%, it needs to go to 15%. That will allow us to really get more traction as we start putting products through the pipe."
0,"It offsets some of our training costs as well. When we look at it, we look at it as a solution really to our customers' labor solution and to ourselves, and it allows us to train and facilitate our training and get people deployed faster. And also when they hit the ground, people today, kids today, we need to put them out there smarter."
0,"It puts us in the middle of a lot of different situations, opens lots of doors for clients. And therefore, it really contributes to the overall profile we have with clients and allows us to really play a larger role with the strategic bearing for our client."
0,"It really furthered our strategy on the business profile. And so, in 2018, what we're looking to do is really capitalize on that, both in terms of integrating the assets we have and really delivering on the promise that we have as an investment where the way we think about it is, we have a great underlying business that allows us to pay a large dividend in the near term around 4%, and then promise out 7% to 8% growth because we have such a good business. It's growing pretty well to 7% to 8% per year, all while we're investing pretty heavily like we did in 2017 into the future of our business, into new assets that will drive new growth for decades to come."
0,"It requires GDP per capita to be high enough so that when we say we save you time and money, time actually equals money. And the other thing that it requires is an infrastructure that allows us to get product from A to B fairly quickly. So our portfolio is pretty streamlined now."
0,"It takes time. On the other hand, the separation will allow us to get there a little sooner. And I think the other thing is, once these two businesses, and now they have the maturity and the scale, I think just looking at how we have run these two businesses over the last two years, on their own, I think they'll be a lot more focused."
0,"It was just the way the contract was written and the way the accounting guideline allowed us to recognize the revenue. Now, we're overcoming this because the new revenue guideline allows us to recognize revenue more smooth and evenly. And when you look at those growth rates in a more consistent pattern, you actually see that this has been growing also to Q4 2017 by 19% and we are looking further to accelerate that as we're now moving into Q1 of 2017 under the new standards."
0,"It's a metric that looks at how much computation is done on the marketplace patient base that we have, growing at 45%. Our connectivity allows us to go back into the marketplace and deliver value in the EHR, in the physician point-of-care environment. That's growing at over 200%."
0,"It's a very well-designed product actually for fibroids. There's some patented technology in this product that allows us to treat the fibroids in somewhere between two to three hours, which we believe is significantly less than other types of treatments. And we believe that there is a relatively younger population in China that would much rather have an incision-free treatment like this than remove the whole uterus, which basically this allows   our treatment allows us to have them   have the ability to have childbirth."

0,"It's data-driven and analytical. And we think that structure and that discipline allows us to systematically drive more effective decisions across the company that we can move even faster on because of our confidence in the type of work and the level of thought and work that goes into everything we do. And it spans everything from marketing to operations, to HR."
0,"It's getting us much more even receipt flow. And what that allows us to do is keep our powder dry so that new trends emerge, we're not fully committed, we can jump on trends as we used to in the past. So that would be kind of the science piece of that that we put in place."
0,"It's hard to be very specific, Jack. What we'll do is we'll integrate their towboats into our horsepower management process, and that will allow us to look at some of our older equipment and retire it, and not miss a beat and not have to expend the capital. It's hard to quantify it."
0,"It's in other things like services and more profitable parts of the market, and we are mix shifting towards that over time. And as a result, we raised the high end of our range to 5% at the Security Analyst Meeting, and we feel confident in our strategy and in our ability to transform the portfolio over time."
0,"It's just a matter of how the individual projects play out. And we'll try to we obviously want to maximize our margins as we go forward, and we think we're in a market which allows us to try and do that in a better way."
0,"it's not going to be overly helpful. What I would say is that our promo is still a very large number, and so we feel confident that within that bucket we should be able to use that money effectively to react. And quite frankly, at the end of the day it comes   even though there's capacity in the marketplace from a competitor, it's going to come down to how strong our product is against theirs."
0,"It's one of the reasons that we can spend as much time as you want on this. But we spend a lot of time on how we're building our own core foundation's platforms, not just the whiz bang apps that sit on top of what the customer might see, but how are we stitching together the plumbing of our own organization that allows us to think through data gathering and support for all of these capabilities with an end-to-end view. And the more banks think through these sorts of things, I think they're going to be in a far better position to defend upstarts or to cede control to folks that are historically outside their space."
0,"It's one quarter under our belt, so I think we're being appropriately conservative as we look forward to the rest of the year. But most of the benefit did flow through and we feel confident with the outlook that we've got for the rest of the year. Q2, I think we got a solid quarter here."
0,"It's probably the most important one. Our platform will allow us to seamlessly integrate microservices created by third parties as well as our customers. However, let me be clear, we'll continue to build finished products for our customers, but instead of building them ground up in monolithic fashion typically it takes years, we're going to assemble them from portfolio of microservices."
0,"It's really more from a deleveraging standpoint. As you think about gross margins going forward, there is always pricing pressures in that channel, but as the low-cost producer, we feel confident in our ability to maintain our gross margins. And from a cost rationalization standpoint, as we deleveraged a little bit, the team at Jeanswear is on it."
0,"I've mentioned this before, but I'll go ahead and say it again. Since we place great focus on getting the people part of our organization right that allows us to put our company in a position to excel. I think it's important to acknowledge the great work of the team and over the last couple of months, we've received four awards that genuinely illustrate what it means to work at Taylor Morrison."
0,"Just in terms of the ICC car park, Adrian, which obviously allows us to do something in Federal Street, currently expecting April for opening of that first block of spaces."
0,"Keep in mind that, right now, its disease awareness and our data are available via APOLLO results. But it's the label and really implementing our field force that'll allows us to get out and reach people in a promotional capacity and that should be a major inflection point for the field."
0,Key to our strategy is the ability to be flexible with our formats in terms of size and design. This allows us to test initiatives internationally before leveraging best practices in the U. S.
0,"Last year, several trillion dollars moved through the faster ACH system that VocaLink runs. So we see this as completely additive to what we do with the business and it allows us to constantly, again, go against our highest priority, which is bringing the best technology, the best experience to bear for what we're trying to solve. So we now see governments around the world looking at these 30, 40-year-old archaic batch-based to ACH systems and looking to modernize them."
0,"Lastly, we will continue to reinvest in the business, including store growth, technology, training our associates, and upgrades to the shopping experience for customers. The tax reform benefit will allow us to move forward some of the spending on investments we planned for our business anyway. We are pleased to be in a position of doing all of this while continuing to deliver great value to our customers."
0,"LEONiQ monitors the health state of a cable and then reports changes in real time. And thus, we have an early warning system which allows us to intervene adequately. So if push comes to shove, Leoni is able to intervene into the control system and for instance shut off the system as a precautionary measure."
0,"Let me focus on trucks, John, because we spent a fair amount of time talking about that at the Deutsche Bank Conference. While we've done very well with the current truck franchise, we think there's significant upside with the next-generation because we've released a number of constraints that we've had that will allow us to drive richer mix. The Silverado, we will have eight very distinct models that will cover the breadth of the portfolio, including up level where the current truck has really underperformed."
0,"Let me give you a brief example. Our recommendations platform allows us to make targeted and relevant merchant recommendations to individual card members based on the card member's location and spending. For example, I live in South Orange, New Jersey."
0,"Listen, I think we feel confident about that business because of our position, our size and this is a business that we didn't grow overnight. This is sort of 10 years in the making of sort of redefining who we are, how we approach the clients holistically, how we partner with our clients, whether it's concept, through our platforms, leverage access and really have built obviously the number one business in the world."
0,"Look, I don't think we're ready to introduce new products or talk time lines on this call. But in general, we're excited about QLC being just a further continuation of the NAND roadmap that allows us to go further kind of into more use cases than the data center. And in particular, when you look at taking advantage of QLC, it's going to take a massive amount of software because it's less reliable."
0,"Look, I think if you look at it Chris I think one other thing to remember about Virtus is that always we provide services for the   for all patients and TFC and full service allows us to deliver patients   to deliver services to patients across first of all, all age groups but also with a   a range of   a range of issues, now we feel that we are the only fertility provider in Australia, but that actually close the full range of patients with both our range of services and our geographical footprint. So, yeah, obviously in typically in TFC, the patients are slightly younger that's we tend to see that."
0,"Look, the last two years, we've been very stable, and we believe that we can take the company to the next level. We feel confident, and that's what we are executing. And the digital expansion will have to grow even faster, so that's something that we are very much focused."
0,"Looking at the connection volume we're driving to those dealers and measuring the impact of not just the direct lead, so that would be a text, a chat, an email, a phone call, but also the clicks to a dealer's website or clicks on the map and directions to a dealership and being able to look at backend data to confirm that ROI and measurement of our program. So, we've known that's a significant opportunity for us given the connection volume we're driving to our dealers. That ROI story will further cement our ability to not only retain dealers, but continue to increase AARSD over time."
0,"manufacturing tax than originally assumed. And then, also, we were able to carry forward our deferred tax assets related to debt and debt restructuring for an infinite period of time, which allows us to utilize those in the future. Those are the two main changes."

0,"Matter of fact, Optym just had their conference at the same hotel a few months ago and the majority of LTL carriers were present. Optym has a technology that allows us to make sure that the right shipments are on the right trailer at the right time and also our manpower is aligned around those shipments. So as I move timely throughout the network creating density and reducing miles on overall shipments and go back to that 940 million mile number that I gave you and our exposure to that area, and any efficiency we create certainly makes a big difference."
0,"Maybe you've already even seen today. And as activist investors, look, we're going to look to unlock the value in certain long positions that we feel confident we could be the catalyst to bridge the gap between current trading value and the ultimate intrinsic value, but at the same time, we have no idea where the market's going. Carl's openly said no one can predict where the market's going, and so we try to hedge out as much macro risk as we can."
0,"Meanwhile, you have someone here that does provide them with something that is regaining share in the space. So, we feel confident both in product and relationship that we're okay. If VW owns Navistar completely or does not, just sits on the board."
0,"Medallion was one of the six health plans   Magellan was one of the six health plans selected to participate in the program which will serve roughly 740,000 Medicaid enrollees. This contract is an expansion of our relationship with Virginia, to serve the managed long-term care population, and allows us to leverage our existing staff and capabilities. The Medallion 4."
0,"Medicare was   well, the company did not have Medicare coverage for since the product was approved back in 2005, and it was a little bit of a challenge because we were neither Part B or Part D, and ultimately successful of really rallying the Omnipod patients, as well as many constituencies that help us make the case for Medicare coverage, and finally achieved it in early January. The good news about getting that early is that it allows us to go through the process where we go out to the Medicare Part D carriers. There's about eight of them   42."
0,"MGP's balance sheet remained strong allowing us to continue to invest to grow as well as return funds to shareholders. We've discussed the strong fundamental cash generating capability of our business, which allows us to provide strong cash flow even as we invest in our warehouse project and grow our library of aging whiskey. 2017 provides a nice example of this as cash flow from operations increased to $33."
0,"Mining, Energy and Industrial Services will provide our current suite of contract Mining services and Engineering, Construction & Maintenance Services to our industrial energy and resource-based customers. This combination of skills and capabilities across many common customers will allow us to meet our customers' needs in the most efficient and comprehensive way. Brendan Petersen, currently Chief Executive Officer of EC&M, has been appointed to the new role of Chief Executive Officer of Mining, Energy and Industrial Services."
0,"Most of our competition does not have, or want preneed counselors; and for those that do, it's a negative cash flow undertaking. Our preneed backlog, consisting of insurance-funded and trust-funded product allows us to grow the future revenues at a faster pace and inflationary pricing. We are continuously driving down cost through the supply chain and improving service levels."
0,Moving now to my presentation. So ST has a broad portfolio of differentiated technologies that allows us to address the various markets and application requirements we target. I would like to highlight 2017 development and our key focus areas for 2018.
0,"Moving to slide 17, concurrent with the business combination we put in place a new $600 million asset backed revolving credit facility and issued $300 million of Senior Secured Notes. The credit facility is an accordion feature that allows us to increase the facility size to $900 million under certain conditions. We used cash on hand and drew on the credit facility to fund the acquisition of Acton in December."
0,"Mozambique is a great example, big resource. Big resource allows us to apply our capability to build big trains in a frontier location. People can build big trains, but to build them in a frontier location is tough."
0,"Net of expected insurance collections that resulted in a $93 million non-cash pre-tax charge to the income statement. In the simplest terms, our claims experience related to these old products has stabilized over the past few years, which provides us with greater predictability around this area and allows us to estimate our exposure to un-asserted claims, which may arise in the future. Ken will review this process in more detail during his financial commentary."
0,"Nevertheless, we still expect 2018 earnings to be at least 10% above the midpoint of last year's guidance. On January 19, FERC issued a Limited Notice to Proceed for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply Header Project, which allows us to begin felling trees. Tree felling started for ACP in Virginia and West Virginia on January 20 and for the Supply Header on January 26."
0,"Next year, we should be able to drive it further down with our optimism next year from earnings and still continuing to hold CapEx tight. And that just really allows us to keep the dry powder of the balance sheet for the next strategic move or acquisition we want to make. So we do feel comfortable with the path we're on and where we're going."
0,"No doubt about it. The other reason to do it, I think, is it allows us to rethink and we reimagine how we manage the business. And I think the advent and implementation of greater uses of technology is going to inform how we actually staff it, and technology people may be as important as investment people are to us in our future."
0,"No, I think it's in the same place as what you've seen us do with Red Rock and Green Valley, it's definitely in a much more centrally located area of Las Vegas, which I think will allow us to get more tourist business in there than the other properties which are further out in the suburbs. And it definitely will have more of a nightlife, day-life entertainment component to it than the other properties, but it's still going to be a hybrid property."
0,"No. I think when you think about the other impact of interest deductibility, we did lose some value from the interest tax shield going from 35% to 21%, but we've got levers from an O&M standpoint and financing standpoint and regulatory mechanisms that allows us to offset that and maintain our earnings commitment for 2018 and going forward."
0,"Now consistent with this strategy, we have a pretty good track record of creatively rebalancing our business from time to time, those who have been investors would know that. And that allows us to focus on what we do best, innovate, invest, compete, build, scale, and grow. And the sale of Austria   UPC Austria is really just the latest example of that."
0,"Now the predominant channel is what we refer to as Customer and Family Engagement. Our post-service follow-up program allows us to be in touch with friends and family members who we've recently served. We also benefit from a significant number of customers coming to one of our locations and who know our brand and express a preference to do business with us, based upon our physical location and favorable reputation."
0,"Now, on unsecured lending, last year, there was an important pricing competition, but we consider than probably now this is   there is some kind of stabilization in this segment. But in any case, despite the spread compression in mortgages, the lower cost of funding will allow us to maintain our net interest margin and keep increasing our NII. So, in this sense that we are optimistic about this issue."
0,"Now, we'll reassess that every year and that'll be based on what we anticipate in terms of excess capital available in the following year, during which we make the buyback. And at that point, if we feel confident about the amount of excess capital, we potentially might revise that CHF 2 billion amount going forward."
0,"Obviously, I have to be careful in that respect. I think as I said in the prepared remarks, with the success that we've had building up our business development function, we feel confident that we can continue to grow the balance sheet and that our origination pace should exceed our repayments. It's just   it's very hard to do that quarter-to-quarter."
0,"Obviously, no system is 100% protected. But one of the real advantages I think again that we bring to the table is we're providing a more comprehensive solution to the consumer which allows us to actually control more of the environment, which allows us to actually offer a higher level of security. If you are just connecting a device to someone's Wi-Fi and their Wi-Fi network is not protected, then you've got some pretty big security holes that truthfully would be almost impossible for a company that does that to control."
0,"Obviously, the component guys sell a tremendous amount of equipment into China. So, it allows us to win however the customer wants to buy."
0,"Obviously, their plan is to try to grow that business by getting more share, getting more ASP, getting preamps to ramp. And so it's not like we're trying to limit ourself there, but we will kind of stick by our modeling, our models that we indicated earlier in the call which is preamp ramping is one of the aspects that allows us to keep HDD \\""""flat\\"""" over the year, but we're not really able to get into the numbers. But as we make progress, you should assume just like everything we've been doing we'll be more transparent."
0,"Obviously, we're going to work hard to increase that, but it's right for us to take a cautious approach because it's very difficult to quantify it exactly. So we've put guidance out there that we feel confident in and let's see how the year develops. Do you want to take inventory?"
0,"Of course, it takes time. Of course, it is a competitive market, but I think the fact that we have a vision that is very complete, we have a vision that is very much software-centric and doesn't have hardware and other pieces to it allows us to attract those engineers that truly want to work on a cognitive platform that is unique in the marketplace. And I think our other products really help strengthen that position, right?"
0,"Of course, the plants are running strongly right now, but we use   over time, we use Saturdays and weekends sometimes to make sure we hit that demand. So we feel confident in our ability to deliver given the flu season that we've seen this year."
0,"Of course, we also pay state and local taxes which takes our projected global operational tax rate to approximately 25% to 27% in 2018. Another important impact of the tax reform to International Paper is the accelerated depreciation which will allow us to develop the full amount of our U. S."
0,"Of course, we were very enthused by the market share results regionally and the fact that we were pulling back on marketing expense at the same time and we're being very selective and strategic in the way we look at the expense cuts. And we're just doing kind of customer at a time segmentation that allows us to reprogram, if you will, what we do. As you might imagine with as many offers as we make to our 36 properties, where we've seen $1 billion a year, those offers don't all go out one-by-one."
0,"On the hosting side, the hosting we're doing the hosting, how, and where we do that is based upon all   in this case with Verizon or even with others we work with the carrier, but in most cases we're doing the hosting, we're going to be looking to take our hosting to some place that is consistent. I can tell you that Tom, that allows us to reduce cost, but also obviously increase the quality of that hosting. So we're working with our partners around the globe and again it depends on partner, it depends on contract."
0,"On the M&A front, our strategy remains consistent. Hospice assets are very pricey, but we have developed a three-pronged hospice strategy, which allows us to invest accordingly and at respectable blended valuations. Overall, we continue to like hospice fundamentals, and as our results show, we are excellent operators in hospice, as such we want to do more."
0,"On the next page, you will find what that really means for us. So, merging those core capabilities and the infrastructure, going forward we think that allows us to really rapidly experiment with new products. With new consumer food products given the data that we have, given the supply chain that we have, given the brand that we have and the fact that we know how to acquire customers at very efficient customer acquisition costs, we really think this sets us up together with our infrastructure that we can rapidly innovate."
0,"On the right side of the slide on page 6, we are providing the bridge on revenue that the game changers represent between 2017 at â‚¬850 million and 2020 at â‚¬1. 5 billion, which will allow us to have â‚¬650 million of additional contribution over the three-year period. The greater contribution should come from our top 100 clients."
0,"On the synergies, as we've talked about, we feel quite confident with the whole of last year to plan for that. So, we feel confidently in a good pace there. Everyone knew the budgets at the end of October, so a lot of planning going on."
0,One of the great things about our network is it's very close to population centers. That's why we're confident that our plan will allow us to pick up business from the highway as truck capacity tightens. We have seen tightness in some markets within the drayage community.
0,"one, continued focus on that local customer, and by doing all those things around the customer experience, we see that momentum starting to build and we feel confident we can keep that momentum going. The other side of it is, as many of you know, we've been a little softer in some of the, what we call, corporately managed side."
0,"One, I think it's a little early on the tax break to tie it to different verticals, so what I can tell you, one, we're excited as a company with our net earnings being up 23. 5% it allows us to do certain things, whether it be M&A, organic hires, look to invest in some of our infrastructure to build out some of our efficiencies as we address folks internally as well as externally and then potentially continue forward with our stock buyback. As it relates to the market, here's a couple different things, one being too early to tell, but there are some indicators as it relates to some of the job increases out there in the market that I think are good indicators for potential spend as the market moves forward."
0,"One, we had a fantastic 2017 by any measure. Two, our multi-brand strategy is working and importantly, our platform allows us to add more brands should the right opportunities and timing present themselves. Three, South Beach is off to a great start in 2018 and is expected to grow more than 150% this year and it's still in its infancy."
0,"OPEN Pride, our employee resource group dedicated to Omnicom's LGBTQ community launched global chapters in Hong Kong, London, Manila, New York City, Mumbai and Shanghai. It is the depth and diversity of our talent that allows us to continue to win more than our fair share of industry awards. There are a few of the highlights from the fourth quarter."
0,operations accordingly. This will allow us to take on larger projects in the U. S.
0,"or North America part of the business. With respect to the overall, I think I should have covered this previously, but with respect to the overall impact, this is really shareholder neutral as   the idea is really here that we're going to a more simplified structure that allows us to complete our transactions that we're looking at."
0,"Our ability to synthesize this feedback from all parts of the investment industry increasingly positions us as a thought leader around emerging investment trends. This feedback allows us to create new content, applications and services, and modify our existing ones to make them more effective. This virtuous circle has allowed us to stay at the forefront of key industry trends like global investing, ES&G and factor investing, and multi-asset class risk and performance management."
0,"Our analytics have identified ways to improve per patient encounter over $2,000 for the total course of care. That allows us to deliver tremendous return on investment for all parts of this ecosystem and bring applications to the post-acute care marketplace that ABILITY serves today with the data, analytics and connectivity enabled through this combination that is unprecedented in the marketplace. As we look at specialty pharmacy, this is an area of perhaps greatest focus in the marketplace today, cost of medications for those high-complexity, high-cost patients."
0,"Our central costs are estimated to be circa â‚¬16 million in 2018, but this will include a number of one-off growth related expenses that will not be incurred in subsequent years. It also reflects the senior management team that we have recruited early in our growth phase, which allows us to de-risk the business. The medium-term target for the group is to reduce central costs below 5% of revenue with further reduction of that percentage over time."
0,"Our commercial pipeline and regulatory progress give us confidence that we are well positioned for sustainable, long-term growth. Importantly, two of our product candidates, dupilumab for allergic diseases and cemiplimab for cancer, each represent a single molecule with the potential for significant opportunities across multiple diseases and are truly pipelines within a product. Turning now to EYLEA, I would like to address the demographic trends that continue to favor EYLEA, the opportunities in diabetic eye diseases which tend to be underdiagnosed and undertreated, an issue we plan to address, and our thoughts on some of the recent competitive developments."
0,Our financial results closing out 2017 allowed us to pay down additional debt in 2018. Our projected performance along with the expected benefit of a lower effective tax rate allows us to declare a dividend with a 10% increase over prior year. And positive economic indicators and strong backlog and demand trends mean we're well-positioned to execute our plans in 2018.
0,"Our fourth point is innovation. In 2017, we began to think more broadly about what and how the Macy's brand allows us to innovate in new categories and channels. We launched a number of pilots and new programs aimed at creating compelling experience in our stores to increase traffic."
0,"Our goals with the district manager program are not only to drive traffic and sales, but to train and proactively support our store managers and associates to better serve our customers which is critical for success in today's retail environment. This structure not only allows us to have a faster execution of strategy, but also provides additional career path options for our employees. We believe some of the improvement in the fourth quarter was the result of the groundwork these district managers have been laying."
0,"Our guidance assumptions do not contemplate any additional sales. Further, we feel confident that we can reduce G&A cost in 2018. Excluding severance costs and non-recurring LTIP costs, G&A was approximately $6."
0,"Our guidance on how much our capital requirement is going to increase remains unchanged, so mid-single digit. And again, that's also though a function of exactly what market conditions, what business plans we ultimately end up framing, but a strong position that certainly allows us to grow the company in the short-term."
0,"Our intent is still to deliver this on 2018, if industry volumes are softer than anticipated, it may take a little longer to get there, but it doesn't change the strategic imperative. And we'll make sure we do that in a manner that allows us to grow EBITDA margins and overall EBITDA. In another words, we're not chasing stabilization and growth at any cost, the growth in a measured and balanced way and I think the team demonstrated our ability to do that, if you look at our EBITDA performance, the U."
0,"Our intention is to achieve these objectives while remaining fiscally vigilant and driving efficiency gains. When this disciplined execution is combined with attractive return profile, we feel confident we can deliver ongoing attractive returns. Slide 10 illustrates the steady growth of our lending footprint as well as the diversity of the overall lending mix."
0,"Our Loyalty Currency Retailing business continued to be a strong cash flow generator for us, enabling us to fund current operating and capital expenditures, as well as our share buyback activity through working capital. During the quarter, our automatic share purchase plan was in effect as part of our normal course issuer bid, which allows us to automatically repurchase shares within quiet periods. Our repurchases during the fourth quarter totaled approximately 172,000 shares at an average price of $11."
0,"Our ManpowerGroup digital ecosystem powers our front office capabilities, improving our interactions with clients and candidates, and allowing our employees to find and match our best talent for our clients and with the best career opportunities for our candidates.

Additionally, as shown on page 7 of the financial supplement, we had another strong quarter and full year of earnings from securities carried at fair value."
0,"Our on-time performance initiative which began in 2016 is showing results, especially on what we call blue sky days.

So deliver the F3-R standard to the French Army; to have contract for the Rafale F4 standard; sign the order of electronic war aircraft, CUGE; take part in the contract that will allow us to launch, develop the whole series of MALE drone European contract program, we will definitely be candidates to obtain the European funds for this cooperation program; pursue the development of the nEUROn, nEUROn is a wonderful test to assess stealth and find out what we can have as combat drones; launch studies for the future combat system, and we are working hand-in-hand with Airbus and with the DGA and with the German DGA; conclude the Mirage 2000-9; continue promotions of Rafales, there are other countries that are going to join Rafale, other countries that already have Rafale that will take options; continue selling Falcons, the whole range, which is being renewed; execute our contracts underway, while respecting the schedules, quality, and costs; pursue our efforts in the field of support, this is something we are pursuing in the civil world and the military world. For France, we will pursue our reforms to allow us to make these aircraft available so that industrialists might be more efficient and at the service of armies."
0,"Our path to deeper personalization is strengthened by growing our Neighbor's Club loyalty program. Our loyalty program allows us to build a more complete picture of each of our members, recognize our most engaged members and tailor our communication messages to each individual. We also know that direct conversations and interactions with our customers are key to our success as a relationship-based retailer."
0,"Our perspective on core EPS accretion after closing, in terms of accretion year one, single digits and thereafter increasing to double-digits has not changed either, yeah. So that, I think, has been a very, very important question, you were asking, because it allows us to clarify, yeah. And then the effect on fiscal 2018 with the combination of Monsanto really depends very much on the time of closing because this being a seasonal business, the first half of the year has a disproportionately higher contribution to sales, in particular, earnings compared to the second one."
0,"Our recently announced acquisition of Validus is another example of a strong start to 2018. The acquisition brings valuable complementary businesses and allows us to expand our capabilities in treaty reinsurance, including access to the ILS market throughout the CAT, a Lloyd's platform, a commercial E&S surplus business and a crop insurer. I've known the Validus leadership team for many years and their underwriting expertise and track record speaks for itself."
0,"Our solid operational results translated into improved financial metrics and increased cash flow and EBITDAX generation throughout the year. The last several years were a challenging time for our industry, but our capital discipline and financings positioned us well for the future with significant opportunities in front of us. Let me briefly touch on our 2017 highlights."
0,"Our strategy has been twofold. First, to sell mature stabilized assets and redeploy the proceeds into higher yielding assets or secondly into returning capital to investors particularly when this allows us to substantially complete the defined investment strategy. Fundraising for real assets in both the public and the private markets for the assets that we manage to remain strong with institutional funds continuing to allocate greater amounts of capital to these sectors."
0,"Our strategy is to differentiate our online merchandise mix to drive incremental sales, and that is what we have been seeing. It also allows us to work with vendors in more ways, further strengthening our relationships. Lastly, our customers love the convenience of making returns in-store."
0,"Our strategy is to really offer value-added services to our customers that result in more volume through all our core transportation networks. And as Alan pointed out, we recently completed a reorganization that allows us to offer a portfolio of solutions in a more seamless manner to our customers. I also want to point out here that this is particularly important to our profitable small and medium customer segment as they expand their e-commerce offerings."
0,"Our What To Expect app installs increased 11% from the third fiscal quarter of 2017 to 441,000. Finally, production of high value unique content allows us to expand our monetization and reinforces the strength of our brands. Notably at IGN, we have debut the weekly program, HERO Makeover which has 1."
0,"Over the last several years, we have maintained the net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2 times in the face of a very challenging oil price environment. Now that the cash flow from the assets has increased, we expect that our profitable growth will allow us to further de-lever. This could trigger a credit rating upgrade in the plan period."
0,Part of the relocation of two spreads is to improve the efficiency and the number of stages per month as well as pricing on those two spreads as well. But I think our teams will continue to improve the level of efficiency that the E&Ps will allow us to get when we're working.
0,"Please limit your time during the Q&A to one question and one follow-up. This allows us to get to more of your questions today. Let me also remind you again that today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website, along with last night's earnings release, the accompanying financial tables, and non-GAAP reconciliations, as well as a very detailed @NFX publication."
0,"Point number three is, fundamentally, we are in a growing business. We expect continued favorable market conditions in the segments we're operating in, and we feel confident that the improvements that we're delivering on will lead us to achieving our financial targets. So, with that, we will move over to the second page of the presentation that says strong order intake in Q4."
0,"Pure Multi-Family has funded the purchase of PURE Fillmore with cash and a new secured credit facility totaling $50 million. The credit facility has an accordion feature that allows us to increase borrowing capacity up to $100 million, which provides us with added financial flexibility and more efficient cash management, which we expect will have a positive impact on our recurring AFFO. At year-end, Pure Multi-Family's portfolio consisted of 22 multifamily properties comprising an aggregate of 7,085 residential units, situated on 351 acres of land with an average unit size of 910 square feet per residential unit."
0,"Regarding our NDA for Primatene Mist, we recently received a general advice letter from the agency which provided feedback on our proposed protocol for our human factor study. The feedback was constructive and allows us to proceed with our study. We currently are conducting a small pilot study, and plan to begin what we believe will be our final study in April."
0,"Remember that we had talked about that the way we were going to address this issue in Missouri, unfortunately, somewhat similar to Ameren as we just wouldn't be able to invest as much if we weren't able to recover adequately. And this allows us to make additional investment that we would perceive we need to make to continue our customer service. It still should fall within our 6% to 8%."
0,"Remember, we're providing mission-critical storage in order to keep that product preserved and have value ultimately for the creditors very often. And historically we have seen customers, we've been afforded critical vendor status, which allows us to realize our collection."
0,"Revenue covers a lot of things. And certainly when you're growing at the pace that we have been on the last few years, it allows us to grow at a smaller rate. We've already made a lot of hires in the last two years to make sure our service model is in a good space."
0,"Revenue from parts sales are up 28% sequentially. Again, our new ERP system allows us to handle this more efficiently and give more visibility to our customers. During the fourth quarter, we received orders to fabricate, sell $16 million of equipment."
0,"Revenues, however, were up 20. 2%, and obviously the math of a fraction allows us to have an improved efficiency ratio despite a 16% growth in OpEx, which is clearly warranted given the growth of the portfolio. In regard to credit performance, we have steady performance."
0,"Right now, hoping to see better rates in the second part of 2018. The strategy we have implemented with the help of the board is able to maintain the company's profitability even in a very negative market environment and allows us to be able to continue our dividend payment policy, looking forward to a better market and hopefully a much higher profits and higher dividend going forward. And with this, I will ask George to give us the details of a very exciting 2017 where we completed a huge new building program."
0,"Right now, I had a captive set of conversations both with Radiant and MDA to actually do that. So, look at us as being very strong and coming out on digital payload with continued innovation, and the pipeline that we have right now allows us to inject these digital payloads and show the innovation that we put forward. The second point was around how do you deal with this, call it, small spacecraft, and U."
0,"Right. And our goal is still industry-leading EBIT margin, and we feel confident we'll be there."
0,"Rodrigo Del Castillo, formerly head of PayGroup, will lead Latin America. We believe that this organization and reporting structure will allow us to operate more effectively and provide for better decision making. Peter will provide additional details on the segment reporting."
0,"S. and China, for example, which allows us to track 24/7 what the consumers are engaging in online and insert ourselves into that conversation. With a brand, take Colgate, that is very iconically all about a smile, all about building a future, a brighter future for the people that use our brand, so we can communicate and have built capability to communicate in 3 seconds, 6 seconds, or 30 seconds, and make sure that the brand's message and brand recall gets through that very cluttered environment."
0,"S. And I think that this ratio, which is substantial, is a strength of the company, because this allows us to, first of all, to be independent when it comes to product capacity, but even more so to really master the way we make the products and the cost of it. Now I would never go to 100% of internal production because that would just make our system too rigid."
0,"S. and out into some of the international markets and we're getting international markets to pay transaction fees in on online ordering or to take Pulse that allows us to spread those investments over a broader number of stores. And so, that helps on the economic front and you've seen that continue to roll out."
0,S. But our system allows us to hold not only data that's in the U. S.
0,"S. but to a level which allows us to regain some margin on this kind of products. And finally in the EAMEA region for Oil & Gas again, for a limited number of customers but significant customers where the prices had been the most under attack in 2015, 2016, because they were almost the only one coming with tenders regularly."
0,S. federal tax rates going forward will allow us to generate a meaningful amount of additional cash flows as a result of our lower tax liabilities. We plan to repatriate a significant amount of the $30 million of foreign cash on hand at December 31 to pay down current debt.
0,S. holding of our foreign operations allows us to retain optionality as a global taxpayer in the years ahead. We will keep you posted on tax matters as the year progresses.
0,"S. Lastly, what's important it really offers us and allows us to provide the customers with the maximum choice and win new customers in those segments, so we're very excited and we'll start integrating the company today. With that, I'll hand it over to Christian GÃ¤rtner."
0,"S. market, there is significant opportunity in the oil and gas place, and we currently are not able to participate in that because our business in the U. S."
0,"S. operations in very good oil field plays, we believe, and allows us to do work on complementary services, as we referred to earlier on, the onsite and Tervita's infrastructure business. Our approach, no matter what we do on a go-forward basis, will always be best assets, best process, best people, all designed to provide continued and improved service to our customer base."
0,"S. Postal Service, so with the GSA SmartPay contracts that we announced, what that allows us to do is essentially bid on government business and there's a limited number of people that can bid. It's those that fit under that umbrella of being contracted by the SmartPay contract."
0,"S. So outside of any increases or decreases in fuel cost, which we do allow to be passed through to us, we feel confident that we can maintain our current transportation costs over the medium term."
0,"S. today; over time, this will allow us to access the vast majority of Baxter's cash in a very tax-efficient manner. As far as the other provisions go, interest deductibility and so on; again, these will not feature prominently in our financial results."
0,"Safety is always our number one priority and we aim to make this year's safety performance even better than last year's record result. We have a strong regulatory model in Michigan that is time-bound, transparent, allows us to have forward-looking visibility, as well as utilization of our investment recovery mechanism in gas. And as a result of the 2016 energy law has added an IRP filing, in parallel, the commission has ordered a five-year electric distribution plan as well."
0,"Second, about a third of our contract types are client interest, which is totally pass through. So that allows us to cover any inflationary input. And the others that are P&L contracts have language that allow us to pass a lot of that through as well."
0,"Second, our institutional market focus. Our LoudCloud analytics platform which allows us to provide institutions with an advanced data driven solution for driving outcomes on their campuses. 60% of students seeking a bachelor's degree at a four-year institution graduate in six years."
0,"Second, the re-measurement of deferred tax assets. Our corporate structure allows us to generate tax benefits for our public company which are shared with IBG Holdings LLC, which is known as the non-controlling interest in our financial statements. Public company retains 15% of these benefits."
0,"Second, we expect to pay down about $3 billion of debt. This will allow us to remain below our target debt ratio of 2. 5 times."
0,"Secondly, there is   once you have the kind of information base that we're creating and I'll speak to our pipeline, in particular, that helps. So, we've got a global CRM system that allows us to look at pipeline. We're now putting metrics around those pipelines that allows us to evaluate the pipeline."
0,"Seven of those we're going to do in ventures. That allows us to control the dilution, reduce our risk and get a little enhanced yield because of management fees and tenant insurance. The stabilized cap rate on those 14 deals was 8."
0,"Severe patients that we can see do response quickly. That allows us to deal with that patient population. But beyond that when you look at the episodic nature of it, these patients   it's not like hemophilia where you have severe, mild or moderate patients, you have patients that will be mild or moderate for a period of time and then also they had a real chronic event."
0,"Since inception, we have focused on reductions in the cost of materials, labor and product warranty, as well as the improvement of yields through process efficiencies. Volume is now the biggest factor in our ability to improve gross margins going forward, as it will allow us to spread fixed overhead costs across increased production volumes. We transitioned our manufacturing operations in recent months to a facility which doubles our manufacturing capacity at only a nominal increase in overall cost."
0,"Since joining the company, I've been pleased that Radian's financial flexibility provides us with the ability to continually work to improve returns for shareholders. Importantly, I'm also pleased with our strong financial position that allows us to serve the housing market, support our customers with products and services they need and to help create sustainable homeownership opportunities for more families. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Cathy for details of our financial position."
0,"Since the inception of our debt investment program in 2008, we have taken New Mountain's approach to private equity and applied it to corporate credit with a consistent focus on defensive growth business models and extensive fundamental research within industries that are already well-known to New Mountain or, more simply put, we invest in recession-resistant businesses that we really know and that we really like. We believe this approach results in a differentiated and sustainable model that allows us to generate attractive risk-adjusted rates of return across changing cycles and market conditions. To achieve our mandate, we utilize the existing New Mountain investment team as our primary underwriting resource."
0,"Since the last investigation closed, as I said, it was found to be dumped but not material injury. We have to wait 12 months, that 12 months is almost up and now allows us to reinitiate another dumping action, which we will be doing."
0,"Since then, we as a company have made a commitment to strengthening our mechanistic and translational research, to better position ourselves for future clinical development across all of our programs. This research will allow us to better understand how to utilize the Resokine pathway as a therapeutic intervention point for both our ORCA and ATYR1923 programs. I'm extremely proud of the high quality and impactful work produced by our research and manufacturing teams and I'm happy to announce today that Ashraf Amanullah has been promoted to Senior Vice President, Biologics Development & Manufacturing, and David King has been promoted to Chief Scientific Officer."
0,"Since we are already operating within our target net leverage range, we intend to use approximately $7 billion of our cash held overseas to repay gross debt. This will allow us to reduce the spread between our gross and net debt levels, support our credit rating and continue to access the commercial paper market and reduce our net interest expense. The remaining cash will continue to be invested overseas, as a significant portion of it is non-remittable because of local regulations or is required for working capital purposes."
0,"So   and indeed, in most cases, there's guidelines there. So, it allows us to pretty accurately predict that incremental gain, many of which have already been achieved, Colin, but some are either in the planning process currently or being designed."
0,"So and we did it through a combination of expense control, inventory control and how we ran things as a company. So we have a flexible structure that allows us to be able to respond in a responsibly   in a cycle and have consistent growth and profitability."
0,"So as the volumes are increasing, we're adding to our capacity, to our systems as we go forward. We're also leveraging the cloud more, so that allows us to scale better. So those are examples of things that we do."
0,"So basically, if we sell, take reorders, clearly the terms and conditions are somewhat different because they are clearly for better, faster service and so   but it's more about readjusting the supply chain and making sure that you actually don't run out of stock, but at the same time, you don't have too much stock in the end. The good thing, going back to our own retail logic, we build significant in-house liquidation capacity through our factory outlets and of course, that now plays a strategic role in the whole portfolio as that allows us to take some inventory risk where we see that there is dynamic customer demand, and we don't let down the consumer who wants to buy quite fast, and/or we are not left with high inventories after the season."
0,"So certainly I would think first-hand the benefit to incidence pricing is so far so good. It also allows us to find end categories where we may not been able to before on our old concentrate model. So if you take sports for example, we had some reasonably low margins within that before in the way that the concentrate model was developed."
0,"So gross debt balances will   are initially going to come down about $7 billion, as we said in our remarks. And that will allow us to then kind of balance out our spread. Over the long term, yes, we have   tax reform gives us the ability to have flexibility with our cash."
0,"So gross margin improvement has been driven to some extent by that, that actually those write-downs are down 50% versus the number of 2015. So, it is all of the things Steve talked about and really this whole fundamental getting back to project execution, doing good work for our clients, being transparent, not surprising them and executing in a manner that allows us to protect more of that gross margin."
0,"So hopefully by our Q1 call, which is only about 45 days away, but if not, by Q2, we will certainly be   have all of the systems in place. We're spending money now on creating those key performance indicator software pieces that will allow us to report really within seconds on any component of our business. And that's well along so we can   when we have these calls, we can deliver KPI performance that you'll be interested in hearing as shareholders."
0,"So I don't know off the top of my head, I can go back and get them to you but I would tell you, it's at a low right now versus where it has been. And then there's significant opportunity to go and recapture some apparel volumes that are there because the category has been challenged and I think we were in the tail end of the fashion shift, right. So, she just wasn't excited to buy a lot of the same stuff that she already had in her closets."
0,"So I hope that helps, but there's no way you can kind of take the midpoint of all those things and come out with a midpoint. There's just going to be some interrelationships that we feel confident in when we give you that overall guidance range for EBITDA."
0,"So I think that hopefully answers the question. On Zalando Fulfillment Services, if I understood the question correctly, so on those Fulfillment Services, we are charging the partner a fee which I think yields a lot of benefit to the partner, because they're able to use many of the efficiencies that we have in our system, but at the same time also allows us to earn a margin on the service. With respect to the gap between active customers and app downloads, I think that's a very fair question."
0,"So I think that tax reform   first of all, I think we are   we would much rather operate under a tax regime at 21% than 35%, full stop. There are some mitigants to that, but I think that we have the planning ability and the creativity and conviction to work through that in a manner that allows us to win from tax reform."
0,"So I think we've really taken a hard look at this and looked at what's the best use of our capital to win in the marketplace. At the same time, meet our overall objectives; that is, to drive profitability that again will allow us to continue to invest in the business. So that's the cycle or I'll say the screens that these investments need to go through."
0,"So I would not actually speak about any negative carry whatsoever. Another reason why Unipol Group holds now has a position in terms of liabilities that we only execute when cost conditions are favorable to us and that allows us to manage quite peacefully all next upcoming expiry date in terms of debt, which we have expanded further because the Unipol Group has â‚¬2. 5 billion approx of bonds issued already and out of these only â‚¬1."
0,"So I'll be quick to point out, it is not strictly an efficiency initiative. It really is about how we leverage the culture that we have in place today, leverage the commitment to customer service that we believe is a hallmark of our business, to really transform the business in a way that will allow us to be sustainable. So   we'll also will be organized into four primary categories."
0,"So I'll tag team with Stephanie as she looks at me that, look, we feel confident. We had time to do the work."
0,"So in instances where our team members earn above the minimum wage after their tipped wages, we're eligible to apply for a credit for that. And as a result of the fact that we have a large number of tipped employees, we're able to tap into that credit, which allows us to lower from the corporate rate. It's also the reason why when earnings are better in the restaurant industry, tax rates go up and when industries are lower tax rates go down because that the leverage that that fixed   basically fixed credit can provide."
0,So innovations for Walmart and others will reach us immediately without incurring an additional development cost. This will allow us to accelerate the time and help us to improve the quality to which we migrate. I'm going to be more direct.
0,"So it's a long answer to saying yes, I expect us to continue to work on costs irrespective of the external environment. When I moved to portfolio, I made a comment about focusing on those assets that are the ones that will allow us to compete and win today and tomorrow. And I do expect us to invest in those things that we think are the assets that will be highly competitive as we move into the future and to test ourselves on the things that may have been really important in our past and may still be or may not be as we go forward."
0,"So it's not all based on orders we have in today, but it is all based on projections that are bottoms-up. So we feel confident about our gross margin prediction."
0,"So it's not always the one that Celgene necessarily will be the winner in that process. Whereas if you work in areas where our scientific insight allows us to look at some assets a little bit earlier, we often do very well because we can kind of see the value, understand how it might play into our portfolio and then as you can see we do a lot of deals in that area. We don't necessarily push all the way for late stage versus medium stage."
0,"So it's somewhat of a counter-intuitive talent strategy, but in places that are booming because they're more competitive like Texas, companies are relocating there, whereas here companies are leaving. And so, it allows us to attract talent here."
0,"So just bear with us as we execute on this plan. I think one of the most important points about this sale is that it will allow us to not only become, as I said, a Permian pure play, but actually it also makes us the only Midland Basin public pure play. And I think that's important because that's where all of our assets are."
0,"So last year, we guided 40% to 45%. Now, we feel confident of increasing that to 45% to 50%. And then, the amortization, as I said, approximately $310 million, and that's our guidance for the year."
0,"So let me start by saying that we were actually really pleased with the Q4 results and that momentum that we saw on the initiatives. Having said that, our philosophy for guide on revenue hasn't changed, I wouldn't say conservative, Brent, I would say that we have a prudent approach to guidance, we want to guide in a range that we feel confident that we can execute on and at this point early in the year, we believe that growth range with a midpoint of around 25% is the right one, it's appropriate for us now. Now there's a couple other questions I think you peppered in there."
0,"So low volatility, we have to compete with a lower overall price in the marketplace that exists. So I think we   as a general rule, I mean, we can compete in all markets, but volatility   a volatile market typically enhance these margins over a long-term allows us to lock customers in for longer periods of time. So I think as a general, we prefer to have more volatility in the market."
0,"So makes a big difference there. The other thing that it allows us to do in terms of the development on top of that is our teams have now developed a common set of APIs for Pulse, so that even in markets that don't use our global online ordering system, they can plug and play into Pulse very easily and effectively. And in that way, when we roll Pulse upgrades out over time, it allows them to then stay plugged into that system."
0,So no surprise here. We feel confident on the guidance that we're giving here. Middle of the range is what we're targeting right now.
0,"So on Monday, two days ago, we introduced 2 for $4 breakfast sandwiches, there's three breakfast sandwiches, you can mix and match and get any 2 for $4. What that allows us to do is punch up our focus on breakfast, but it doesn't disrupt or interrupt the whole $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu, because it's just kind of a supplement to that. And so, we like the long-term construct of this menu."
0,"So please do not take it out of proportion that it won't influence long-term, short-term models in the wrong way. I do believe that in mid longer time perspective of two, three years, it will allow us to become very significant player also in Japan."
0,"So that completely eliminates, at least, for the time being, consideration of products that move through distribution. We just don't want to   we want something that will allow us to leverage this customer equity that we have right now. So, that's the long answer."
0,"So that's an important part of it. It also allows us to continue working with Bechtel our EPCM manager, and putting together execution team. We're very fortunate in terms of the timing of this project."
0,"So that's something that we'll be working through now into April, beginning of May. Our goal and our hope is that we will then be able to fill the first batches before the end of the second quarter, that will allow us to put drug up on stability. Because we're using post-approval change, our goal is to be able to submit a Prior Approval Supplement to FDA to trigger an inspection probably at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and then it really depends on the FDA."
0,So the idea that we continue to put new products into their hands we think is a good thing. It allows us to continue to approach multiple specialties and multiple docs. I think one other comment you just made is we do to your point about a headwind recognize that there was that step down in our sales force.
0,So the Mickey Mehta activity actually allows us to use those centers in a more objective manner.
0,"So the take rates, they're all the same, the terms and conditions. And that allows us to go out and basically light up 2 million merchants almost overnight. And I think that's a very important aspect, though, that is at least when I came to PayPal, I didn't appreciate the significance of it."
0,"So there's a number of things. And we, like I said, we feel confident, but timing of deals haven't done this for 20 years, I know, they never occur on the timetable you'd like them to have, so."
0,"So they bought a lot of what we would call toxic assets at times. While they also bought some strong assets, typically the strong assets that they bought were performing at a very high level, whereas we typically only buy very strong assets or franchises, the six majors in mainline franchises, as well as the three primary luxuries that underperform, okay, which allows us to buy them at attractive ROEs. Well, now, without a lot of that competition out there, we believe that the market is pretty ripe."
0,So those trends continue. We have   we feel confident that there's a recapture. I'd be remiss to say whether that's the full recapture or half of recapture or someone in between.
0,"So turning to slide 20, and coming back to why we think this is a compelling combination. This transaction will allow us to realize significant pools of synergies. And first of all, it's very important to note that the synergies we're presenting are the result of some very detailed analysis, which we've done together with MTG."
0,"So unlike others who may have started by building sales systems for mom-and-pop businesses, our heritage is delivering true automation systems that drive real business value and can do it at enterprise scale. The addition of our CRM apps allows us to punch through to the front office, with the power of our core digital process capabilities and every day our software is powering millions of automated processes and trillions of dollars of business. So, as we think about this strategy, I'm pleased that we have six concrete differentiators that Pega is based on, that really allow us to draw a distinction between other people who are in the space or aspiring to be in the space and I'm going to briefly touch on all six."
0,"So we are looking at different possibilities. We do know that we want to develop our own non-profit arm to Progressive Care, to PharmCo which will allow us to take advantage of some government grants. But again, that's part of a non-profit effort and not so much for profit pharmacy."
0,"So we can't say a lot about the details at this point in time, but we're looking forward to further progress in our discussions. We feel confident that we'll get there on these things. And in the next couple of months, we'll have some more details on these initiatives that we have underway."
0,"So we expect to see a benefit to margin with our shrink reduction really starting in Q2 and for the balance of the year. And because we have fewer inventories, we're not going to see that benefit in Q1, but we feel like we have gotten our arms around it and we feel confident that that number is going to come down versus last year."
0,"So we feel very good on also those aspects. So all of that really leads to that we feel very comfortable with that we will continue to generate a very strong cash generation that will allow us to continue to look at M&A. So I can anticipate one question, I'm sure I will get."
0,"So we have to   we're going through the pros and cons of how we want to approach that. But most importantly, I think for sure we're now going to be first in this effort and that allows us to set the pace for all others, who may attempt to follow."
0,"So we have to be creative in how we do this. We think peak losses are in 2018, and so the option allows us to avoid most of the losses. Certainly, the losses for 2018, and we think that it gets better on a going-forward basis after that."
0,"So we take a certain investment at the beginning and we see the ongoing return over that investment. So when we have cash in the bank, it allows us to take such deals, observe the initial investments and see the returns over the term of the agreement. We normally seek between three to five year agreements and we do the initial investment on our dime again using some of the cash that we have and we provide this end-to-end solution on a monthly recurring basis."
0,"So we think this is a reasonable approach. From my perspective, this allows us to put early year guardrails around cost. Now everyone here associates, managers, executive leadership, are all incented to beat the plan and beat the objectives."
0,"So we'll have to see if that happens. But if it does, again, we feel confident that we have all the clinical data to counter that also with Toujeo on our side."
0,"So we're committed to it. Second point I would make is the Tax Act is good for the company, it's good for the economy and it will allow us to return more capital over the next few years to shareholders than we otherwise would have been. It did drive a Q4 charge but our suspension of the share repurchase for the first half of 2018 will substantially rebuild our capital levels."
0,"So we're not bumping it all back a year, let me put it that way. But we are   as I say, there's probably more   there is more investment, maybe it allows us to make the investments that we are doing."
0,"So we're not going to ever give up on it, but we're not going to chase it at ever spiraling cost curve, instead we're focused on driving ARPU in our business. And our strategic shift allows us to drive ARPU by getting these fewer number of subscribers but at far higher ARPU."
0,"So we're pleased with the final 2017 number. We feel confident in our 2018 financials as well. As I mentioned, the backlog, very high backlog."
0,"So we're trying to package that up and make it accessible to others. On the ground systems side, we're increasingly productizing our ground systems that helps with the vertical integration with DigitalGlobe to have a more efficient Maxar offerings, but also allows us to have different scalable sizes of ground systems for those in the new economy that are looking for new business models and new ways of having effective ground stations for their systems. In the world of on-orbit servicing, which you'll see a little bit more about as we go through the day and there are certainly good demonstrations about that out in the demonstration area, we've taken that big legacy of robotics on the big space station world and packaged that up into a design for reconfigurable kit for sort of smaller-sized robotics within the factor tools and a ground station that we can then offer to various groups around the world that are interested in having robotics and tooling for on-orbit servicing missions."
0,"So we're working on making that a stand-alone capability in the product. That will allow us to sell in different places in stores and sell with a focus on home security. And then once we get a customer, obviously, we'll try to educate them on the great benefits we can bring on the phone side as well."
0,"So we've always taken a balanced approach. As we see opportunities in acquisitions, we'll steer it there. I would give you   I guess, if I gave you a priority for our free cash flow in 2018, it's probably going to be to invest in ourselves."
0,"So we've done some thorough work, have very strong bids from our supplier in a fixed price manner. And so at this juncture, we feel confident that we have a good understanding of what it's going to take for this phase and appropriately took those costs in Q4. Charlie, anything you want to add?"
0,"So we've got significant spending in there that is not shale and tight and then we've got the shale and tight spending. And as we've said a couple of times, our plan there is the same today as it was a year ago and the same as it was two years ago is to build a highly capital efficient approach to development and we believe that that budget will allow us to do that and maintain those efficiencies."
0,So we've got some frozen Hog that we're going to use to run through Huonville for the second half so we don't pull forward any fish out of our current harvest for second half of this financial year. So allows us to balance out the growth again. We had strong operating returns and operating cash flow.
0,"So we've moved everyone to 4G which means a significant improvement in terms of the coverage and the satisfaction. So, we feel confident that within a few months that's going to become a minor element. Obviously at the same time, we're working with Orange to support any improvements that are needed to the network."
0,"So what integrity means is that we have to do business legally and ethically. So, for Keppel, it is very clear to us that, as I said earlier, we have the capabilities and the solutions that will allow us to win business legitimately within the laws, within the rules and also ethically, and that will be something we will pursue. Okay."
0,"So what we spend on TV because it has a higher attribution than, let's say, paid search we'll spend more on TV than what are allowable would be on paid search or affiliates. But we have attribution model in place that allows us to think through that. We actually don't give our marketing team a marketing budget."
0,"So what we're knocking down is ALAS, which is the top of the heme biosynthetic pathway. That allows us to get rid of the toxic intermediates ALA and PBG and there's very little on target   or anticipated on target toxicity at all. It's not required for blood supply, for example, or any of those other aspects."
0,"So what's nice about it is it hits almost every single channel that we do business in, which that breadth really helps our portfolio. It allows us to continue with the earnings power that we have."
0,"So when we look at our cash flow versus EPS   when we look at our cash flow, we're only expecting a modest positive impact from tax reform over the next couple of years. But it's a tailwind nonetheless and it certainly allows us to continue to invest with confidence in the business. But those investments to a degree are investments that we've been making regardless."
0,"So when we think about productivity, we don't view that as a trade-off for price and volume. Productivity to a fair degree is in our control, and things that we are consuming, paying for, organized for, in order to provide an excellent customer service, which allows us to price in the marketplace. So I don't think we see it as a trade-off like that."
0,"So you may see some quarterly fluctuations, but we simply are focused on longer term value creation in terms of maximizing growth and profitability. And as it relates to any individual whether it's a product or a channel, we'll prioritize those accordingly and build the business in a way that allows us to be profitable on an annual basis with fluctuations in-between the years."
0,"So you'll find much more of a focus around ortho and total joint, spine, pain, GI. Things like GI and ophthalmology, I'd just remind folks that while those aren't our core in terms of our high-dollar focus, they're very much our bread and butter and that they generate nice cash flow and they provide the cash flow that allows us to continue to do some of the M&As as we pursue these higher dollar, higher contribution margin businesses. So hopefully that answered your question, Ralph."
0,"So your body keeps generating antibodies that has the ability to have mild vaccine responses, respond to normal immune responses, and so you're continuing to generate it. So it allows us to really shut off the recycling, to bring those levels of autoantibodies down. But the other beauty of it is if we need to take this drug off, so we haven't seen any sign of infection, so you needed to actually have your full anybody complement back, we can stop giving our drug and within 7 to 14 days, your full antibody complement back."
0,"So, a lot of the focus will be on finding best practices and opportunities to reduce the overhead and fixed cost burden that sits in both companies as they sit separately. But as they come together, there should be significant opportunities to reduce those costs. So, that will be a big focus initially."
0,"So, although we're trying to manage and watch that profile, that's against that backdrop of those flexible and robust cash flows that I mentioned earlier in the presentation. So, it allows us to look through and see the pattern evolving and make some of those judgments as we go along rather than it be a very choppy evolution of cash."
0,"So, as I said earlier, the $550-plus million that we now have access to allows us to move eptinezumab substantially forward and invest in all the things that we need to be investing in to make it successful. What we said on our call earlier this morning was is that we're going to come back after we've had some chance to sharpen our pencils and provide more specific guidance in our year-end call that's upcoming to give you more granularity on that."
0,"So, as we highlighted last quarter, we have a high degree of financial flexibility and we anticipate a number of years of earnings growth and significant free cash flow. This allows us to continue to invest in long-term growth, while enhancing cash returns to shareholders. And finally on the next slide a few comments on U."
0,"So, as we've gone through cycles in the defense market and the business jet market, how do we adapt to that? And we believe our business model and the agility of that business model allows us to maintain our cost curves inside our revenue curves and improve margins despite what might be going on on the top line. You've certainly seen that performance over the past several years, so I think that's a critical, critical element of what our business model brings to our performance."
0,"So, as we've gone through cycles in the defense market and the business jet market, how do we adapt to that? And we believe our business model and the agility of that business model allows us to maintain our cost curves inside our revenue curves and improve margins, despite what might be going on in the top line. You've certainly seen that performance over the past several years, so I think that's a critical element of what our business model brings to our performance."
0,"So, basically, Azita, the breakdown is as follows, about MYR 350 million, MYR 150 million, MYR 700 million, MYR 150 million, around MYR 700-odd million. But, Azita, some of those expenses, we can actually recoup because some of these expansion CapEx, the government allows us to recoup via offset of user fee. As well as this expenditure on Aeropolis, this also allow to be recouped via user fee offset."
0,"So, Bill, as I mentioned, for this year we're 85% covered and so we're comfortable for this year. Obviously, in terms of pricing, we assess on a global basis market-by-market and we'll take actions where we see opportunities."
0,"So, certainly, as we mentioned the relationship with CITIC and Harbin will allow us to accelerate the Blue Hat registration process. Again, going to market in China is very different than it is in the U."
0,"So, every single private label client uses the loyalty platform of Epsilon. Every single private label client will use a lot of the demographic and psychographic data that Epsilon has, permission-based email, the unique ID that Conversant has that allows us to go out and know that it's you on whichever of the three devices you're on, through the ability to identify you based upon where you've signed in over the course of the day. And so it sort of supports a lot of the other businesses."
0,"So, first, from a Square perspective, we've kept a very small amount of Bitcoin that's held by Square. That allows us to just add a little bit more liquidity as we're growing, but our intent is not to hold a lot of Bitcoin on the balance sheet. Maybe I'll pass to Jack on the question around Bitcoin sourcing and storing."
0,"So, guess what, we gain a lot of productivity and we gain a lot of quality, you are so great, that's your job, well done. But what this allows us to do is spend time with our clients on a much more regular and granular basis showing the product, showing that it works, downloading it, getting that feedback. So, you get a lot more collaboration with your clients, you get a lot more chance to go lockstep with them through the processes."
0,"So, I am convinced about that and I've been that for a long time and still convinced today as I've been all the time. Secondly, don't forget that we've a strategy, it allows us to grow faster than the market. It should not be forgotten."
0,"So, I do think that that's a great benefit of our model. It allows us to give customers that really broad selection that is first order defined by size of inventory, but I think second order also, it's a richer inventory conditional on size because of our optimization equation being different."
0,"So, I don't want to give that to somebody else and all of a sudden they're getting a bill from   not from LabCorp, but from somebody who's a billing service. On the bad debt opportunity, again, you'll see that   you'll see the demonstration after lunch, but showing the patient what they are owing at the time of service and being able to collect an exact dollar amount that we know from eligibility check is what the patient is going to owe, is a very significant opportunity. Being able over time to move that out into the physician office, so that the doctor can tell the patient exactly what the patient responsibility is going to be, again just the greater and broader the engagement with the patient, the better our opportunity to collect at the time of service, as opposed to once the time of service is over having to send a bill and chase."
0,"So, I feel confident that we get some new views on certain things while maintaining the steady development we have had for several years in those areas. So, this is   going into 2018, we feel confident and we feel that we are definitely on the right track in, not on all activities. We shouldn't be on the right track on all activities."
0,"So, I guess I've been on the job about three months, and I have spent a lot of that time evaluating the people, the assets in the business of Cenovus. To be clear, the board brought me in as an agent of change, and it was clear to me very early on that there were significant opportunities to streamline the organization. And from my perspective, I really thought it was very important to get the right people in the right jobs as soon as possible."
0,"So, I think for the benefit of this call, the premise of all our conversations and proposal is that we will maintain the continuity of that service. And therefore, whatever we'll be able to free will actually serve the interest of the MNOs as well as will allow us to continue serving our business going forward."
0,"So, I think if I had to say hospitals for a number of reasons some just because the way Christmas and New Year's fell, the CFOs being gone, we got hit with a little of that in some cases and those orders have come in. It's really just a basic push out that we feel confident that we'll correct itself."
0,"So, I think if you look at us as a management team, and if you want to   you're welcome to evaluate me all you want as well, I think that's  the way we're going to balanced and prudently run the company. We gave guidance for the year, we feel confident, we   again, we use the words prudent and balanced by design. We don't want to get out over our skis, but we're confident this is really a great business and we have a long runway, and we'll just continue to execute and measure some of what we do and   versus what we say we're going to do, and  we think right now, we're okay in that regard."
0,"So, I think it's a very good thing that we're able to stop and go. It allows us to go back and, first of all, fine tune the offering if there's something the customers like better that we may have missed. But it also allows us to adjust risk, and if we're not getting the take rate we want, we just stop."
0,"So, I think the ordinary dividend, we're always keen to maintain a good payout ratio and make sure we can drive that forward broadly in line with the growth in earnings. So, then it leaves the opportunity to use the balance sheet and the cash generation for one of two things really, inorganic expansion through M&A, or returns to shareholders, and we're very clear that if we see opportunities to grow beyond just the technology acquisitions, which are quite small in terms of outlay, then we will bolt-ons, maybe something bigger if those opportunities develop in the chemical sector over the coming period or we'll return money to shareholders. We're very clear around that."
0,"So, I think the trends there are positive and I think the inflation in our working book, we back engineer all of that to assume on the working book in Motor is running at about 1. 5% to 2%, which we think is very positive and certainly allows us to gather margin as we get ahead of the market in terms of our repair processes."
0,"So, I think we're single-threaded in a lot of ways, it's a lot of resources. I don't believe that there's any significant opportunity on this development side to take it out. Where we think we've got a benefit is when we start ramping up and we have a production methodology that is more machine-controlled and not very labor-intensive, that's where the efficiencies come to bear."
0,"So, if you think about late last year and going into the rest of 2018, we've begun to roll out DOCSIS 3. 1, which allows us to offer 1 gigabit speeds. We'll have that through the entire footprint."
0,"So, I'll start with your first question there around the quarterly cadence of sales and the relative growth rates. So if you think about it, over the course of the year, the only   I think it was Mike that asked the question around the contribution, will allow us to get additional price benefit to a certain extent in the first quarter. But beyond that, as you think   as you translate into the second half of the year, obviously, our expectation is that we'll have inject coming online and we'll start to make that measured launch of that product, but you also could have the additional impact of additional competitive trying and trialing in the second half that have   that also offset a bit, which is the reason why the net of that, I think, is a slightly more muted seasonality than you would typically expect just from directly translating the cataract market itself."
0,"So, in that segment, it's again two-fold. On the one hand, we decided to do certain fit-outs out for all tenants, that's for example the toilets or the floors, which then is cheaper for all together and it allows us to justify high rents there. And then we have the option, some tenants want the fit-outs to themselves, especially of course, the longer thinking tenants, tenants that do their head office also here and other tenants prefer to take that options of doing the full fit-out on our half."
0,"So, in the near term, in the next three to four, five years, I don't see any impact on our cash flow related to this change. And as Dan mentioned in his prepared remarks, we expect to be able to, at some point in the future, refinance and to get a lower interest rate as well as our operating earnings will increase which will allow us to have more deductibility capability as we move forward."
0,"So, it really depends on the supply demand within that end derivatives. And I'd say at the start of the year, that demand has been pretty solid and strong that allows us to take the right appropriate pricing actions to respond to that volatility in propylene in 2018. We do expect some challenges in the second half of the year on olefin spreads as some of the more of the ethylene drive elements of it."
0,"So, it still offers an attractive spread relative to the yields on our investments, and given the fact that we have the capital, it makes sense to do that. It allows us to, again, to decouple the pace of investing. If we want to pay it off quickly, we could do that, but if we anticipate that, for example, we may draw it down but then we may have a period, so April, for example, is a relatively not a great month to do bulk transfers given we have a lot of calls already about taxes and so forth."
0,"So, it's a mining issue and refining the stope shapes. And so, as we get our grade control system ramping up which is underway now and operational, get our RC program as part of that grade control going, those stope shapes will become more and more refined, which will allow us to zero in more on the grade and be able to deliver better grade to the mill. So, going forward, we would expect grade reconciliation to be far more robust than based on that first five months where we didn't have grade control and we're running just off the bulk model."
0,"So, it's definitely impacting engineering productivity and predictability of quality of delivering solutions. And we talked pretty regularly about our kind of heritage and experience to build professional software products and this is one of the components, which allows us to differentiate ourselves. So, it's a pure differentiation of quality of final deliverables."
0,"So, it's important to note that in all of our two randomized trials, 100% of the patients enrolled were indicated for revision surgery. So, that allows us to make a pretty compelling health economic argument because obviously, after the treatment of SINUVA, that number is drastically reduced. And so, what we've found is that argument is relatively straightforward from a health economic standpoint."
0,"So, just to say that yesterday night we announced that we have signed a partnership with Amazon to develop Monoprix offer on Amazon Prime Now. This will allow us to offer to Amazon Prime customer ultra-fast delivery in Paris and the suburb of Paris in between one and three hours' time. And it gives Monoprix the action to Amazon Prime customer and enlarge our customer base."
0,"So, let me know if I've got your question accurately. But I think the question was around learning from some of the applications that have been done in human health and applying them to animal health and specifically related to CRISPR technology if we see opportunity for that within the animal health area?"
0,"So, Martin, it's difficult and we're reluctant to give a forward-looking statement. But we feel confident. And we can see also on the ground that as we expand our commercial programs and the realignment of the assortment in our stores in the field, we can see and feel a positive store-by-store impact."
0,"So, new products is really a major underpin, and I couldn't be more proud of the way the business had done it. We've now got a machine that allows us to put great ideas in the front-end and out-pops great new products over and over and over again. And it's about the system and structure that gets that to happen as opposed to having a great project engineer that delivers a good project and then a bad one delivers a bad one."
0,"So, nothing really changed from our angle. And I think it just continues to signal even in a year where we do see some challenges, we feel confident in our free cash flow generation capabilities."
0,"So, NRG I mean I think we'll look at anybody NRG Yieldco and other providers. I mean what this allows us to do is actually find the most cost competitive, most effective way to provide a solution for our customer. Now, we don't have it internally."
0,"So, obviously we don't comment on future plans for buyback, but what I would say in that regard is, as we look at the $50 million that we did buy back in 2017, I think that's a result of the fact that we've made significant progress in the strategic transformation, which has resulted in strong cash generated from operations, almost $100 million in 2017. And based on this performance, we feel confident   the Board feels confident in the business, and we believe that share buyback is an appropriate way to create shareholder value. And our goal is continue to be a strong cash flow generating company, and then to use that cash to continue to improve the value of the business."
0,"So, our focus is on enhancing the personalization and customization of the experience for our customers which drives higher satisfaction. By automating it allows us to make it high quality replicable services at a lower cost to serve. So actually, you'll see the migration from voice in the call centers and other things."
0,"So, since we've been doing that, we're pretty reasonably well positioned for the environment that we're in. We're nibbling around the edges where we see opportunities. But we're not inclined to change the overall risk profile of the portfolio in response to recent developments."
0,"So, that has relatively small amount of our overall revenue relative to the opportunity it represents. So, that's an example, certainly not the only example, but an example of how, by going vertical, it allows us to put more focus on that without taking away from the focus of the verticals that we've done well in. A good example of how the verticals are already paying dividends is in the finance sector."
0,"So, that's about half of our services business today. That allows us to move up the value stack. So the second area, about 30% of our services business is payment services."
0,"So, that's hugely positive. And that will allow us to look at managing our liquids down in the coming periods. Deposit funding, very strong, up at 68%; transaction account growth just under 15% up; and NSFR now at 110%."
0,"So, that's just stops them in their tracks. What we're bringing to market shortly is the ability when Blue Coat sees a website that's never been hit before or web page that has never been hit before, to go back to the Endpoint and say what's on the other end of this, and pick up all that data, allows us to really understand was that the use of doing that or whether there's some bad code on the Endpoint."
0,"So, that's the long-term position which provides a really strong base for our operations. It also allows us to do much better production planning and scheduling so we have more optimum production lines. Should we expect fewer, large, lumpy orders?"
0,"So, that's what we're doing. We're basically saying, we want to take that approach; it allows us to convert out of those fixed income investments into equities. So now we think we can grow that pie more."
0,"So, the ITC has the fastest time line of any IP court. It allows us to take multiple respondents into one single case, so all of these people into one case. And the International Trade Commission will grant an exclusion order."
0,"So, the most important on the technology side, we want to remain as horizontal as possible. But with a high degree of mindfulness around when we see opportunities in different verticals that are very similar or there's pattern, how can we build a horizontal solution that serves multiple verticals. And so, even in the case of GxP compliance, while life sciences happens to be the predominant buyer of GxP compliance, it actually works in other very process-driven industries, in aerospace and other spaces where you want to be able to understand the quality of the systems that you're using is what GxP compliance is all about."
0,"So, the remainder is from the platform. You will appreciate that now we are building out our framework in such a way that payments and platforms is coming together, which means that we typically offer a solution, which allows us to monetize out of payments. And that is the role and that is path that we've undertaken because that makes our platform as well as payments business very sticky."
0,"So, there is a lot of work to be done on delivering good tenders and developing good solutions. We feel confident that we will win some of these. How many?"
0,"So, there may be potentially some scope for taking a little bit more time over that move. But we feel confident the mechanics of the move are significantly less risky than the move down to Juarez was. We are confident that we have a workforce that understands the processes that we are putting into play down there."
0,"So, there's just different pieces of it. And I don't want to get into specific pieces from a competitive standpoint, that we feel confident that the gross margin decrease that we will see next year will be less than what we've seen in the fourth quarter."
0,"So, they often travel into the Sprint network areas that don't have the quality of service that Sprint provides in their urban areas. Taking over these in-between areas allows us to improve the quality of service to match the rest of our network and provide a bridge to the quality network that Sprint has in the urban areas, providing all Sprint customers a better network experience. The new territory covers approximately 1."
0,"So, they're motivated to drive that area, no doubt. And I've got people on my team that are the judge and jury on that, making sure that that's paid out in the right manner, so, we all have the checks and balances and hold each other accountable and the constructive tension that Keith speaks of that allows us to be effective."
0,"So, things such as 3. 0 and Audience Network allows us to start to go into these new marketplaces, that is local broadcasters we couldn't do before. And that's important, because we do have to follow the ad dollar and the viewer through the ecosystem."
0,"So, this isn't like I'm not saying we shouldn't be able to talk about things forever, but we're into territory that we don't exactly understand. And so, yes, we feel confident that the things that we're doing will drive at the right direction, and that as time moves forward, we should be able to come back to you and tell you here's the success that we're having or here's the lack of success that we're having. And if we don't have success, here's what we're going to do about it and make your judgment."
0,"So, we are not at any point going to chase growth for the sake of chasing growth, and I want to be really clear on that. So, to the extent the market allows us to grow at the upper end and we can maintain our credit box and credit standards, and as Scott talked about, moving the book closer to a 50% mix of secured, which is where we'd ultimately like to be, we will see the higher end. To the extent we don't see the loans we want to book, it may wind up at the lower end."
0,"So, we deliver hundreds of thousands of mandated design build and test every year in the feature function picture. So that's all good and it allows us to improve our quality, improve our productivity. But the next stage for this which is why I'm mentioning in front of you, is banks have challenges deploying quickly through the numerous test environments that they want to run, any major changes software."
0,"So, we do have, as you would expect, financial metrics that will be largely determined by our performance on sales and margins. But beyond that, we have several other metrics that relate to reduction in G&A, leveraging the company to a place that allows us to take on slightly more debt, and also bringing down the G&A, and completing the refranchising if I didn't mention that. So, we know that those strategic things that essentially transform the business model are what add value not just for the shareholders, but for all of our stakeholders."
0,"So, we do think we've got an advantage. I think the big thing for us that Grubhub allows us to do in the U. S."
0,"So, we have a fair amount of dry powder. That also allows us   our current facility allows us to go up to 3. 5 times leverage net debt to EBITDA, and up to actually 3."
0,"So, we haven't seen, as you relate to market pressures or competitiveness, much pressure below those points at this stage. So, we feel confident that we can continue to transition out of those assets, free up other capitals and look to diversify the existing balance sheet to layer in both on those first lien spreads and the Logan spreads."
0,"So, we now have a focused efforts   so it's really a cost-overrun for case movements on the shipping. So the reason we feel confident that we can remedy that is that we have now taken back control of that facility and we're well on track to moving that in the right direction. So, we do feel good about the progress that we're making."
0,"So, we see it as a great opportunity to drive our   to the model that we're talking about, getting to 40/20/20. And it certainly allows us to drive rapid gross   top line as well."
0,"So, we're very excited about it. We feel confident about our ability to deploy it into several applications and we feel confident that we're deploying it geographically. But that will be a 2018 exercise."
0,"So, we've got people in place already that can   that have that expertise in-house and through collaborations we'll either find platforms that make sense or be able to access those platforms in a way that we can generate novel matter. But again, we'll do that in a way that's thoughtful and P&L-friendly, and one that allows us to spend a little bit of money upfront, but really back-end and pay for success when that's there. So, I think, it makes sense again for how we want to run the business and how we want to put capital to work where we're paying for success, and not paying for a lot of risk upfront with this big upfront."
0,"So, we've got to find a way to make ourselves relevant to those patients. And it could be through the product   not just the products that we bring from a generic perspective, but it could be a branded OTC franchise that gets us to where we become relevant to patients, and then allows us to lever that into a distribution, potentially a distribution model. We're still in the early phases of thinking this through, and we're watching very closely what others are doing."
0,"So, we've reached out to them. I think we can come up with a plan that is fair that will allow us to continue to invest in the business. More to come on that as we get a little further along with our lenders."
0,"So, what we're doing is simplifying our go-to-market strategy on value by removing layers and concentrating on the most powerful ones, but also making sure that we spend enough time crafting exciting LTOs that don't necessary need to be about the price point, but it's more about what you get on the value equation. So, an example is Carhop Classic where we call sharper everyday value which is a compelling entry price point with very high-quality products that allows us to also aspire to have an halo to our base business because allows us to tell the story of quality that we have in the brand. In this case, we are talking about the burgers prepared to order and also our onion rings that are hand-prepared and hand-breaded each morning in our restaurant."
0,"So, when everything shows back up and we go to bolt it together, we know it's going to go together the correct way the first try. And that allows us to have a very competitive time to market for our products."
0,"South Beach was developed by a leading cardiologist, which is   makes it a very heart-healthy diet. So in addition to addressing different psychographics of how a consumer may or may not want to lose weight, each program allows us to get deeper into a health segment as well."
0,"Speaking further regarding our long-term effective tax rate, we also have seen an increase in earnings globally. This increase in earnings in certain jurisdictions will allow us to access net operating losses previously deemed unusable by U. S."
0,"Subsequent to year end on February 9, we expanded our unsecured revolving credit facility from $500 million to $600 million and expanded the accordion feature from $300 million to $800 million. This allows us to increase the maximum borrowing capacity under the facility up to $1. 4 billion."
0,"Sure. We think we continue to invest in the infrastructure of the bank and what we think is that that really allows us to scale our overall business model and to continue to offer differentiated levels of client service, particularly as we grow. I think in terms of the efficiency ratio, I'd refer you back to Mike's earlier comments on our expectations for 2018."
0,"Sypris Technologies generated a positive operating income for the fourth quarter, its first profit since 2014 and what we expect will be the beginning of sustained profitability for this segment. We ended production at our Broadway facility during the fourth quarter, which completes the production transition process and allows us to move forward and begin realizing the associated cost savings. This action also marks the completion of the major actions that were identified to drive our two-year $26."
0,"tax reform in 2018 will be neutral to slightly positive to EPS at approximately 2% to 3% negative to 2018 EBITDA which is certainly within the planning parameters that we have for normal variability in our business cycle, whether from wind, hydrology, weather or unforeseen events. We have always operated Algonquin in a manner that allows us to adjust to this modest level of variability and our EBITDA without disrupting our business plans. So with that backdrop, let's unpack some of the larger elements of tax reform."
0,"temperature-controlled warehouses, third-party managed warehouses and transportation. This allows us to service the specific needs of each of our customers, while enhancing our knowledge and experience in the cold chain. The largest and most profitable segment is our temperature-controlled warehouse business."
0,"Thank you for having us. So, I think, starting out it's important to understand that antisense technology and the power of the antisense technology allows us to address diseases that up to this point have been un-addressable by other modalities. And I think that's a sort of foundational principle for Ionis."
0,"Thank you, Chuck, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited to be part of the Airgain team, and I strongly believe there are significant opportunities ahead of us. Let's turn to our financial results and highlights for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017."
0,"Thankfully, the chassis availability at Work Truck Solutions has improved and the supply restrictions are returning towards normal. Overall, we feel confident about our long-term business prospects for both segments. We still have just over 30 days of winter left and we have approximately average snowfall across most of our core markets so far this season."
0,"Thanks for the questions. So with respect to the CF   cystic fibrosis development, let's assume that we have a readout over the next trial that allows us to continue the right time and the right format. What is important is to remember is that the main aspect of RPL554's different activities in CF is probably an anti-inflammatory effect."
0,"That accelerated transformation gets me $50 million more savings by 2020, and obviously, that'll ramp into 2019, but that's why we think it's a pretty good payback. It allows us to do things like continue to drive Services margins, but as importantly, address our Hardware margin challenge. That's why we want to do it now."
0,"that are going to allow us to realize the full global commercial potential of eptinezumab, and I stress that because that's an important part of the consideration for us. And also that it allows us to realize the full commercial potential of eptinezumab beyond what we can achieve on our own. Beyond these remarks, I'm not going to provide any further details associated with these activities or comment on ongoing dialog."
0,"that are out there today. That gives us a very significant opportunity to pursue. And so, all of these resources they sort of overlap and intertwine, but the consequence of all of it is a thorough understanding of the market that's out there and how we're going to go and address it effectively and appropriately."
0,"That is 50 to 75 basis points because of the underlying commodity pressure, not 75 to 125 basis points in a more benign commodity environment. So we think we've been realistic, and we think we have the tools that will allow us to get there."
0,"That is not part of our plan of course, we can't control the weather. But the thing that I would say is there's a very strong emphasis on capital employed at the Wheel business and also efficiencies, investment selectively in equipment that will allow us to obtain higher margins. Our margins are increasing and I think we make the over-the-hump in the Wheels side of that business, the market has gotten more stable."
0,"That means using predictive models to recommend posts in Connect you're more likely to be inspired by or suggest recipes you might like based on your past scanned items and tracking behavior. Together, data engineering, analytics and data science are a powerful trifecta, that allows us to leverage the gold mines of data that we have at our disposal, for the greater good, making our members more successful, whoever they are, wherever they are, and that's the power of data and analytics at WW."
0,"That product is based on the relationships and the kind of lead which we get and which part of the country we get the lead from. As far as overall target is concerned, please understand that we are working very hard first to create a technology-driven channel which will allow us to capitalize on this leads in a very, very different way. So I would not like to venture into kind of giving the target at this point in time."
0,that we want to be in. So what that allows us to do is to be very opportunistic and disciplined in terms of growth. We don't have to grow.
0,That would be correct. And we feel confident about the $20 million and we also feel confident about the revenue that we guided as well.
0,"That's   our ultimate goal is trying to put together our acreage, which will allow us to drill longer laterals. We do it every day in the Bakken."
0,"That's a great question, Margaret. It allows us to talk about digital health and connected health beyond just the United States. We've had excellent progress the last 3."
0,"That's a significant opportunity, now the market is depressed, right."
0,"That's a slight drag on 2018, but I would say nothing overly dramatic. Generally speaking, we feel confident in the $1. 4 billion."
0,"That's not something we're sharing at this time, and frankly we need to sharpen our understanding of our customer   we have a lot more data now than we used to. Before HERO5, well actually since the launch of HERO5 we have a connected camera that's connecting to our app which now has a log-in which allows us to do a much better job of understanding our customers' behavior. We have a cloud subscription service that also has important data feeds."
0,"That's one of the reasons we were encouraged by the FDA's approach, which was rather than setting up discipline-specific meetings, they recommended to us that we submit data that addresses the information request to the IND on a rolling basis. What that allows us to do is to make sure that we're addressing these in a timely fashion. I want you to know that we've also submitted to the FDA a timeline for us to address these requests, which they now have."
0,"That's our goal and that's what we're going to accomplish. And that allows us to mitigate rate impacts in our capital plan. We've also moved away from the ratio of O&M to gross margin, mainly because of the tax reform."
0,"That's where it all starts. And with that having been said, what that allows us to do is to grow our corporate ROCE annually, to grow our annual cash flow, and to generate free cash flow in the model. In fact, it shows us generating free cash flow at $50 in 2020 if that were to be the commodity price."
0,"That's why we are throwing these numbers out. While we do have plans to continue to explore additional distribution channels; if it allows us to sell more than 100,000 cars at a reasonable profitability, we'll do so."
0,"That's why when we looked at these, some of these players talked about, whether it's Semtech or IDT or MACOM, those guys didn't ring in our ears as being real CMOS integrator threats. And so, that's where really   our core foundational integration CMOS platform capabilities is really what allows us to do what other people theoretically think they can do, but often have   very difficult executing on. Even   in almost every market that we've competed against Broadcom, who's the   I mean they're the archetype of this mixed-signal integration SoC play, we've been able to execute."
0,"The additional proceeds from the benefit of tax reform allow us to get there a little faster. The key here is to have a strong balance sheet that allows us to pursue and execute on our strategy as quickly and as efficiently as we can. So as I say, we haven't given an exact leverage target, but you should expect us to deleverage from where we are today."
0,"The answer is yes, okay? Developing our own network allows us to do the cherry picking and roll out the network where the relative costs are lower and the possibility for getting high penetration is higher, meaning high-density areas and residential areas that are close to our existing fiber network. So, doing a rollout of a network doesn't mean we'll cover everybody, but we can still do a very viable   economically viable plan to reach a lot of customers just within our own rollout of a network."
0,"The assets comprise 705,000 square feet and generate approximately 3% of the company's NOI. We feel confident that these will be sold this year and have list them to held for disposition. We are working to identify acquisition assets, which we can exchange in order to protect the gain from the sale."
0,"The back end of that study, meaning Dose 2, we'll report out in the first half of this year. The third study is an open-label safety study, which allows us to complete the safety database required for the FDA for our BLA submission. That is now fully enrolled, and we'll see the data from that in the first half of this year as well."
0,"The capital associated with that is not extensive, but the timing associated with that has dragged a bit. I think we've got a good solution in hand that allows us to get that facility to breakeven, probably as we get into the second quarter this year. I think we'll still have a bit of a drag here in the first quarter."
0,"The company enters the second half of the year with 610 sale contracts carried forward, representing a gross value just over AUD 207 million and we expect to settle these in the second half of 2018 or during financial year 2019. And as I mentioned, our deployment of capital into acquisitions during financial year 2017 allows us to drive strongly ahead in terms of sales and delivery with only selective acquisitions anticipated for this year. We've seen our average sales rate increase with strong contributions from financial year 2017 project releases."
0,"The credit rating that we have, I mean, from time-to-time, we had questions related to the governance and CEO search but for the most part, our ABS investors are focused on that Chesapeake platform and the credit quality it actually provides. So as I mentioned earlier, we will be on the road in a couple of weeks and we feel confident that we'll be able to do the size of the term deals at the prices that we expect to have similar to what we did last year."
0,"The delta there is your working capital piece, which is your balance sheet absorption or release which is that thin slither of the absorption of about Â£20 million in 2017. The record of the  business you can see there is a powerful reminder of the cash generative nature of this business, which has been a permanent feature of Persimmon over the years, which allows us to look at capital return   the level of capital return in a positive fashion. I'd like to think that we are progressive in terms of our annual reviews, our continual reviews of the amount of capital we do return."
0,"The domestic content is still wide open. I will tell you though that to the extent which they're talking about, to the extent they include intellectual property in the domestic content number, it should really not be a big deal for us because that will allow us to count the value of the software and the sort of the intellectual property we put into the products that are manufactured in Mexico. So again, we're way off where we were from a impact of something like a border adjustment tax, so this is manageable."
0,"The early Discovery business, which is primarily our Chemistry and Biology business, was a tougher one to integrate. I think we had some integration challenges that were self-imposed, but it allows us to start with the clients really early either, as I just indicated a moment ago, either actually find them a new target or characterize their own targets better or do a whole host of in vitro work that we can ever do before and have a very elegant handoff to other parts of our business. The in vivo parts of Discovery are more straight forward for us; high growth and really good margins."
0,"The feedback loop we have created in ECT and CICT is very strong and has allowed us to see more chemistry applications than ever before. This in turn allows us to develop better, more cost effective solutions faster than our competition while also enhancing our intellectual property. We're listening to our clients, and we will deliver at a cadence that our competition cannot keep pace with."
0,"The feedback we receive from this survey will be translated into targeted retention plans for each major market to reduce turnover and enhance employee satisfaction. We believe that taking a personal interest in the feedback of those who work with and for us will allow us to continue to minimize wage pressures across the company and improve resident experience. Finally, we continue to work diligently in identifying and achieving economies of scale to reduce the expenses and add value to our operators in the field."
0,"The financing does not change our internal expectations. Back to my prior point, it allows us to stay nimble..."
0,"The first is EBITDA. RPC uses EBITDA as a measure of operating performance because it allows us to compare performance consistently over various periods without regard to changes in our capital structure. The second set of non-GAAP financial measures is net income and diluted earnings per share, excluding the impact of the implementation of tax reform."
0,"The first one is that we truly believe that price competitivity is a key element for our competitiveness and for   if we want to be attractive. All the investments that we're going to make will allow us to gain in competitivity, especially in terms of prices. And gaining in price competivity means that we need to think about the role of prices, the role of discounts, and the role of loyalty programs."
0,"The FlexVolt technology allowed us to take cordless power tools and move up the power curve to 60 volt and 120 volt tools, but at the same time have that battery be backwards compatible for our existing 20 volt system. So it allows us to continue to build out the ecosystem of the DEWALT corded power tools system. FlexVolt is a great introduction of breakthrough technology that we launched almost two years ago now."
0,"The freelance market is growing faster than the W-2 way of employing people. And so, I think that also allows us to capture that segment of the market which is clearly growing faster than the traditional part of the economy, which is the traditional W-2 employee."
0,"The further adoption in the exposure to Telecom Italia will be done through sale, through disposal. We already shared that we have a target more or less of â‚¬80 million, â‚¬90 million of disposal per year that will allow us to further reduce the exposure to the sole tenant Telecom Italia. Second point on guidance, yes, it is correct."
0,"The GDP growth was positive. There's still   I think we've got a good healthy group of clients that allows us to really work with them. We've had great fundings in Alberta, so that's positive."
0,"The green shoots of our economy have afforded the Federal Reserve the ability to increase short-term interest rates and to start to decrease their balance sheet. While we expect 2018 to be a challenging market for fixed income assets, we feel confident in our portfolio's ability to continue to produce a strong dividend for our investors. Last night, we announced a $0."
0,The lending side of the consumer business is modest and mainly comprised of mortgage assets and small business loans. It brings incremental diversification and allows us to support our Southern California footprint. Our Consumer Banking segment deliver stable funding and a growing base of customers.
0,"The logistics network is very complex and it is not an easy network, we do not have huge delivery companies as outside of Brazil. So in 2010, we woke up to the situation and we invested in this proprietary platform and this platform today allows us to carry out 97% of the 1P deliveries. And today, over half of the sellers use B2W deliveries and within the B2W deliveries, we take care of most of the logistics."
0,"The long-term impact will be between $100 million and $140 million annually. The impact will allow us to provide enhanced shareholder return, while investing in our business, employees and communities. Investments in the business will begin in the second quarter."
0,"The M&A pipeline remains full and we hope to share more with you over the course of the year. Rogers has utilized approximately 50% of its historic operating cash flow to repay debt obligations which allows us to maintain additional liquidity, to access our revolver as needed for strategic acquisition activity. To the extent we have excess cash, we'll return it to the shareholders as evidenced by our share repurchase program."
0,"The majority of this frac is fully contracted under demand based contracts. Next the 400 million cubic foot per day agreement with Enable, which will allow us to begin fully utilizing idled pipeline capacity and processing capacity in North Texas is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2018. This contract will fill all unused capacity at our 700 million cubic foot per day Godley plant with the majority under a 10-year demand agreement."

0,"The management contracts in both Hodges Bay and Landings has allowed us to have a presence in Antigua and St. Lucia in a very asset-like manner that allows us to get the experience and to understand the markets better. And as much as I've lived and worked in those islands, we still have better experience understanding how the systems work and understanding the labor costs and working with the unions and so on."
0,"The new aviation vertical is working out well. We did the CIT Northbridge joint venture, which really allows us to capture on some of the economics of deals in the ABL space that go into the non-bank space. Real Estate, going into the year with a strong pipeline."
0,"The next slide highlights why our NanoFlu vaccine is different, and why it can be more effective against both sources of mismatch. First, NanoFlu is recombinant and allows us to make a vaccine that from a genetic standpoint exactly matches the virus sequence of the CDC's recommended flu strains. It's not an egg-based manufacturing process."
0,"The one in AML, we plan to have all comers AML patients because of the broad activity that we have there. And that will allow us to dose escalate faster with the patients, because we are not fragmenting the patients taking one-third of that that are flipped through ITD. And so, we help to be able to dose escalate on that quickly and again all comers in AML."
0,"The other aspect is basically throughput from the mining through the crushers, conveyors and up to the process plant itself. And we are seeing a steady increase in performance and what we're able to treat, and there's a whole series of debottlenecking and small projects will allow us to get to the target, which is 55 million tonnes per annum through that facility. And we anticipate that we will do that with   it will continue to improve this year and next year as well."
0,"The other thing that it was very useful to us is we don't have to keep going in the capital markets because we don't have to keep doing large distributions every year. So, it allows us to retain and not dilute our investors and it means that we don't have as much debt load because we don't need to supplement what we make with either debt or capital rises. As far as the taxes and capital implications both at the time we did it and in the current tax reform I'd like Gabe respond to that."
0,"The other thing, so what does Intercept X drive on the renewal rate? Well, what we've been seeing now for a while, and this is also related to Sophos Central, we've seen good growth in Sophos Central, the platform that allows us to easily ship these products or for partners and customers to install and get the security benefit. That's really helped with Intercept X but also with Server."
0,"The other things that the tax reform does is, obviously, reduces our structural tax rate, allowing us to compete more effectively against the worldwide competitors that we compete with every day. It allows us to repatriate a significant amount of cash that's been sitting outside of the U. S."
0,"The Permian, for so many other sand producers, contains numerous unknowns, obstacles that can only be effectively planned for and addressed through direct experience. Our expertise in construction and operation of various frac sand facilities built up over seven years of near constant project development allows us to move quickly with confidence and deliver ahead of schedule. As a result, we are well along in the stage of fine-tuning and optimizing our processes."
0,"The price gap is now back to its historic average with our main competitors. So, as we said, we start the year with a good position, which are comfortable and competitive price position that allows us to be positive for the year. Whether this improvement was driven by inflation or volumes?"
0,"The project is the first one launched by Duqm Refinery & Petrochemical Industries Company, a joint venture between the Oman Oil Company and Kuwait Petroleum Corporation. The project will be secured in consortium with CB&I and will allow us to be back in a very important country. Commercial activities are very intense across all the product lines of the E&C Onshore Division as we show in the slide."
0,"The regulated business is the CE Mark, waiting for CE Mark as well as FDA. With CE, it will allow us to be able to do what we call RoW, which is Rest of World. We do have a definite plan scheduled with that."
0,"The rest of our 1 million square feet or so at CentreGreen is 100% leased. So, we feel confident about our ability to re-lease it. And whether it goes single tenant or multi-tenant, too early to tell."
0,"The rest was to support other market participants, and we want to land that point today. Slide 25 talks about the GWAP/TWAP again, and we want to show you that actually the way we manage it allows us to create an advantage in the market and some value for shareholders. And we now believe that's a systemic capability that we have in the business."
0,"The same thing happens after project has occurred 12 months to 18 months later, a post completion assessment is completed again. That allows us to demonstrate we are getting the returns and is there any learnings that we can apply for future investments. So typically what you'd expect for the bottlenecks and kind of other low capital projects we've been seeing, returns 20% above."
0,"The second is to pursue the broader indication for the chronic sinusitis trial. And all I say is that relative to those two areas, which are the significant use of capital in the next several years, we feel confident we're well-capitalized."
0,"The second main driver of our outperformance is that, while these tenants are looking to grow store counts, they are more focused than ever on occupancy cost and four-wall profitability. Our proven locations and low average in-place rent allows us to effectively compete for the very best tenants while still driving growth. As I've said on many prior calls, a high in-place ABR can be a tremendous liability in this environment."
0,The third quarter was marked by the completion of the Montchevre acquisition. It allows us to broaden our presence in the U. S.
0,"The trainer which will be selected in the second quarter of 2018, two of the three applicants for that on the airplane level are flying the F404. So we feel confident when the trainer decision is made. We have a pretty good shot of probability for a win."
0,"The transaction is expected to be accretive to adjusted net income per share in 2018 and we expect the transaction to be accretive to GAAP EPS in 2019. The flexibility of our current capital structure and our strong cash position allows us to borrow on our existing revolving credit facility at closing, while maintaining $155 million of availability. Pro forma for the borrowing, our total net leverage will be a modest 3 times and our ample cash flow will comfortably service the additional $6 million in annual interest expense from this borrowing."
0,"The transaction will not affect the end-consumer's tariffs in both countries and will build stronger TSOs capable to efficiently realize the ambition of our society, a carbon-free power system. Being a group of TSOs at the center of Europe will allow us to generate new and critical knowledge to realize the energy transition. Many thanks for your attention."
0,"The triples take us to a point with these large double-digit increases even in the het/mins. We're very confident that a single triple will allow us to treat up to 90% of all patients. And so then the question becomes   you become a lot less interested in agents that might be synergistic and add 1-point more, because 1-point more on 13% or 14% just isn't as important."
0,The trust we built is not something that we take for granted. It is that we allows us to build our integrated platform over the last 20 years. We will honor that trust going forward as we work to increase our industry leading position.
0,"Then for the older kids, it is patients who have kept, who have either undergone partial surgery and then kind of maintained on standard of care or other medical it's more exploratory treatments and that's why we want to go in and show for these children, we can reduce the number of hypoglycemic events and severity of living with this disease until they grow out of the disease. And I mean the key thing here is where we will of course by far create the biggest, you can say transformation for these children is in the neonates, because we prevent surgery but the older children will contribute also to the safety database and understanding how to use this treatment in the long run, so that's why we believe the two studies together will allow us to get a very attractive label ultimately for treatment of these patients. For dual-hormone artificial pancreas, actually I did take you question and I provided that answer but I can just say it's a 4 to 6-week or 8-week study where we will test the iLet using dual hormones versus running in a single hormone mode."
0,"There are a significant amount of onetime costs built into 2017 and 2018, then obviously go away, the $30 million being the biggest example of that for the advertising contribution. But we believe then this will allow us to return the bulk of this to shareholders because we got minimal CapEx requirements. So, if you look at revenue, single-digit growth, $738 million to $900 million; EBITDA, obviously, growing mid-single-digit growth; but adjusted free cash flow jumping significantly from $63 million to $175 million and EPS, I think, correspondingly moving from $4."
0,"There are not necessarily initiatives that we started this year that will get us to the 11%. This is ongoing initiatives around better client selection, better project selection, working on mission-critical work that will leverage our expertise, that will allow us to increase our fee on those jobs and that's what we've been able to do. And as I said before, it's an ongoing effort to manage your utilization within the company being more efficient and more agile in the way we manage utilization and project management."
0,"There is a mobile, an app for a mobile phone that uses the camera and you essentially hold the camera over the phone and I'm sorry over the tag, it captures that data it geo-tags the location where that that was scanned. It tells us if there was a legitimate book or not, and allows us to also record events like when the product was   like the manufacturing piece and the shipment piece et cetera. All of these data is then registered to a dashboard."
0,"There is simply no reason for this REIT to trade at such a high yield given the track record and the low lease turnover for the next two years. I always complain about being criticized for being externally-managed but, folks, being externally-managed allows us to access a team of credit underwriters unlike any other internally-managed REIT. Our high occupancy level is a testament to this access that we have."
0,"There remains a high clinical need in the market to treat these conditions that have not been adequately addressed. We are encouraged by our agreement with the FDA on a likely plan for exertional heat stroke and remain hopeful that our ongoing discussions with FDA and our clinical work will allow us to continue to advance RYANODEX for these important indications. With that, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and open the call for questions."
0,"There will be maybe some Upper Devonian mixed in there on occasion but we're talking Marcellus and Utica. And there is a strategy behind that that allows us to take advantage of some blending of dry Utica gas with damp Marcellus gas to keep our gathering and processing costs at a minimal level, so to avoid some processing on the damp Marcellus gas. So the Utica wells are strategically scheduled in there to be able to blend with the damp Marcellus gas."
0,"There's a few areas that we do monitor externally, just to see if we're seeing some additional changes there that I think everybody is focused on leveraged lending and trying to see what's going on especially in the shadow banks, because I think more of it's been held   hosted there as opposed to on the traditional banks. We also have a large commercial real estate servicing business, and that allows us to take a snapshot on a regular basis as to what's happening to retail properties and multifamily properties and other things just to see if we're getting any indications or signs that there might be some pressure down the road, and the data, it's performing pretty well."
0,"There's an awful lot of recommendations out there. If this review provides some clarity and allows us to move on, then that would be good. But right now, I think the industry is healthily working to the benefit of consumers and managing that balance of shareholder and community needs."
0,"There's some risk and we're watching closely. Over the long run, we feel confident that we're very well placed to navigate the transition."
0,"There's some transition cost in a ramp-up period for the providers if we were to go the outsource route that they would need to make some investments which we would need to fund. So the savings themselves we feel confident that we're going to be able to deliver those, but really we won't see the impact of those until 2019 predominately."
0,There's three good reasons for that. The first is that it allows us to continue to build cash on the balance sheet and certainly at these prices we're going to build cash. It looks like a very good environment.
0,"These cash receipts were partially offset by cash to use to fund operations. As Sean mentioned, our strong balance sheet allows us to fund operations into 2020 assuming no new collaborations or financings. Research and development expenses were $92."
0,These four planks of productivity continue to yield for us. And technology allows us to continue to push the state of the art in each of these four. So let me just close by coming back to our model.
0,"These include raising our minimum wage to $11 an hour, providing onetime bonuses for eligible hourly and store associates and improving our paid leave programs. We believe these actions will allow us to continue to attract and retain a talented and growing workforce of over 82,000 associates, who have been critical to our past performance and will be key to our future success. Further, our board recently approved an increase in our stock repurchase authorization for 2018 to $1."
0,"These opportunities take a bit longer to conclude, so they are not included in our active pipeline. We continue to believe that LTC's strong balance sheet makes us extremely competitive in the marketplace for new investments and allows us to move quickly as opportunities materialize. Now, I'll finish with a few comments on our portfolio."
0,"They also tend to sell for a higher price point per square foot than man-made products. Number three, we have implemented a new sales associate compensation system that we believe will allow us to attract and retain top sales talent. We have always been proud of the fact that being a sales associate at The Tile Shop is not like other retail jobs."
0,"They couldn't keep up with the growth of their   many of their client segments. So putting a bigger balance sheet behind City National allows us to attract new clients, stay in relationships, lead relationships to a greater degree, cross-sell our capital markets capabilities on ECM, DCM side. So bringing these franchises together had so many synergies."
0,"They use us daily and enable them to solve mission-critical problems. This platform in the cloud allows us to expand rapidly and deploy instantly additional applications. With over 44,000 sites of care, the myABILITY platform plays an integral role in all sizes of acute, post-acute and ambulatory facilities."
0,"They were aggressive at going after some of our largest customers, in particular, by paying large significant sign-up bonuses and they were able to attract one or two of them. We feel confident, again, that for the most part that's been stemmed and we have, like I said, a very solid pipeline. We continue to sign-up new and large customers, and those new customers coming on to our system, especially because they come on with clean data set and they don't have any of the issues of data migration, are not experiencing any of the challenges that our customers were experiencing through the integration."
0,"They'll continue to remain on nonaccrual, which allows us to put all payments to principal and that's a prudent thing to do."
0,"They'll tend to settle in alignment with each other. So, now we really move our focus, as Ryan mentioned in his call script, to really drive that   successfully drive the customer number up, which will allow us to sustain and retain more of those sales leaders."
0,"They're designed to be rebuildable. So having an asset that has this unique very young age allows us to have emissions efficiency. These are the cleanest type of assets that we have in the compression industry today, very emissions-friendly, environmentally-friendly and very flexible and fuel-efficient."
0,"Think of it as a rescue receptor, grabs onto the Fc tail of the antibody, as cells come along to digest your proteins, which they turn over your proteins every couple of days and then hangs onto it, brings it inside the cell and releases it without digesting it. And so that receptor allows us to have long persistence of antibodies, which is generally a good thing, but not when you have an autoimmune disease, where your antibodies are attacking your body. But what you want to do is drive antibody relative to that quickly."
0,"Third, after years of testing, we have found a promotional formula that works well for the long-term. We have an extremely loyal consumer base and knowing their long-term value allows us to balance consumer acquisition costs with our retail partners. We will always invest in new consumer acquisition as this is a considered purchase given the long-term benefit to the business."
0,"This actually we've done and we can show you, which allows us on literally every time we sign a lease to calculate what the effective rent is on that deal, net of everything, compared to what we have in the plan for that space. So, that allows us to dynamically adjust our forecast and our budget for that particular piece of property. And then, we can aggregate those differences by location and by submarket and by all kinds of different variables."
0,"This expanded relationship supports our continued reach within the rapidly-growing digital payments channel. We have built a strong reputation in this space and this program will allow us to meet evolving consumer needs. We primarily compete on our capabilities, including our significant experience, scale, dedicated teams, data analytics, loyalty programs, digital capabilities and proven record of providing value-added services to our partners."
0,This gives us a real advantage of scale and reach. It allows us to make compelling offers for both Shell businesses and the third parties we work with.
0,"This is a plant producing extrusion ingots. We are planning to start the production in 2020, which allows us to implement a new technology element from the pilot that we are testing out. The investment of this restart will   to finance this restart will be NOK 1."
0,"This is actually   the intention between the GPAS in the marketplace is to become the equivalent of the App Store for the gaming industry. We have access to 800 games and this tool allows us to basically generate hundreds of games every year. Some will be bespoke, some will be developed by third-party content providers, and some by Playtech."
0,"This is actually real that helps us take our smart vehicles, link it with the smart world and try and understand what happens. It allows us to grapple ahead of time with technology's unintended consequences. And together with cities and partners, mayors are talking to us all the time, we're charting a human-centered course forward, human-centered course."
0,"This is an understood asset for many of us, because of its shareowner structure or the fact that it's been for many years in and out of separate companies, consolidated, proposals to buy as such. And as we've looked at Sky, we see opportunities in all those areas and it will be amazing for our Comcast shareholders and the Comcast management team to work with the Sky team to say, how do we accelerate your plans. And when we got to NBCUniversal and had those same conversations, the results were radically different than they had been previously."
0,"This is consistent with the past few years as we have increased our consignment levels. Third, our cash balance allows us to provide necessary liquidity through all market conditions with about 10% of trailing 12-month revenue and our 12 months of dividend payments. Finally, we're simplifying how we communicate two of our targets."
0,"This is hard work. This is not easy but this is the journey we're on inside the company and that's why we feel confident about our performance going forward. So, Tom mentioned this simplification really is about everything we do, it's that whole 80/20 concept, applying where can you create value, the quickest, it's going to give us better speed, better customer experience, it redesigns work processes and organization, and really   and enables growth and financial performance."
0,"This make, buy, blend optimization is key to creating value. It allows us to constantly adapt to market conditions and hydrocarbon supply and demand positions. We work in a similar way with our Chemicals manufacturing facilities to optimize the supply of LPG, naphtha and other feedstocks."
0,"This morning in a couple of one on ones people have asked at what point do we see us kind of reaching that rate threshold and we don't see it anytime soon. We still think that there's a couple of cycles ahead that allows us to be able to drive value to make it consistent with the audience that we're capturing on these platforms relative to the revenue that we're receiving from those platforms. And as we've seen many of the MVPDs are not absorbing those costs, but they're passing along to consumers."
0,"This morning, we announced a new open market buyback program that will commence immediately. The new program will allow us to repurchase up to $40 million worth of our shares over the course of the next 12 months. As I have discussed on past calls where they we're active with this program in any given quarter because of surely tactical decision based on the prevalent share price relative to the threshold set by the board at the beginning of the period."
0,"This overcome the â‚¬10 billion threshold for the first time in several years, then further supports our growth investment increased dividend policies. To conclude, we are confident that the continued execution of our strategy and the flexibility embedded in our well diversified integrated model will allow us to sustain growth create long-term value for our stakeholders including communities and people. And on this basis we confirm our 2018 financial targets and we will continue to work hard to deliver on this guidance."
0,"This resulted in a lower fourth quarter product sales and $50 million of refining margin realization in our California region that we expect to occur in the first half of 2018 during our major maintenance. This will allow us to meet our customers' needs during this maintenance and during a period of stronger overall demand for the region. Second, we recognized derivative losses of $85 million related to crude oil inventory that was hedged as well as forward pricing of a portion of Canadian crude oil supply for the St."
0,"This should mean improvement to price realization and a gross margin tailwind that has not existed in the past few years. Our productivity efforts will allow us to sustain our expense leverage, creating the prospects for strong incremental margins. And on top of this, the tax reform significantly enhances the earnings power of our business and allows for more return of capital to shareholders as evidenced by a recent dividend increase."
0,"This shows you over the last five years, how our markets have gone up and down, but look at that cash flow in the blue bar. It's very steady because in times of market declines, we liquidate working capital and that allows us to ensure that we're taking steps to grow earnings regardless of the impact from weaker markets. We have said that we intend to target more M&A."
0,"This slide describes the current state of our asset light model and the need to capture synergies within our Pharmaceutical Ingredients business versus a future state where we can add a vertical integration strategy along with owning our own intellectual property around ANDAs and APIs, including DMFs and potential formulation expertise. The goal here is to balance our asset light model with more ownership, which will allow us to create more profitability for the business. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Doug to provide a more detailed review of our second quarter financial results."
0,"This tends to be more of a relationship sitting down and negotiating directly with the vendor. And so, good news is that allows us to do numbers that work very well for the unitholder. The bad news is it means we can't just pick up the phone and do deals next week because we decide next week is a good time to do deals."
0,"This vehicle segment has remained hydraulic and will be hydraulic for the foreseeable future. We had already begun working with Sheppard on application of MTO technology and that allows us to pilot vehicle control under baseline hydraulics. You recall that we're already in production on MTO on GM three-quarter ton full size trucks, they take it to market to consumers called digital steering."
0,"This will be complemented by sustainable trading income, because we now have a portfolio that covers China, Vietnam and Singapore. So it allows us to diversify this and to be able to spread out the earnings, the trading incomes over the years. I would hesitate to say over the quarter, because on a quarterly basis, it depends on the handover, depending on some of the other timings."
0,"This will be initiated as an outline here, we anticipate within the first quarter and completed by the middle of the third quarter of this year. Thereafter, given the requirements of the 505(b)(2) pathway, a switch study from current treatment options to the treprostinil delivery program and the pivotal pharmacokinetics study, both of which include a limited number but an efficient number of patients that will allow us to assess safety, tolerability, the efficacy, and the patient-reported outcomes or tolerability of treprostinil delivered through the Technosphere platform. So this gives you, I hope, some insight into the clinical research, clinical development, medical, regulatory, and safety programs that will highlight 2018."
0,"This will enhance our free cash flow by around $100 million a year. Over time, we expect that tax reform will allow us to invest more in our business and to have more cash flow available to return to shareholders. With a solid 2017 behind us, we're enthusiastic about our prospects as we start 2018."
0,"This will position us to build stronger relationships, improve our asset selection and win more deals. In addition, greater scale will allow us to finance larger transactions in the upper middle market where competition is more limited and risk-adjusted returns are more compelling, reduce fund expenses and approve cost of capital for the Fund. Over time, the combination of our enhanced origination capability, improved lending solution and scale should lead to significant value creation for FSIC investors."
0,"Throughout 2018, we expect to make meaningful progress with these programs and to achieve a number of important milestones. We look forward to appointing a new president for BioReference Lab and expect that this new leadership, along with our ongoing investment in operational efficiency and continued growth and expansion, will allow us to return our laboratory business back to growth mode. We look forward to keeping apprised of our progress in all our businesses."
0,"To be clear, the last two items are very important. This now allows us to repatriate approximately $4 billion with minimal, if any, expected foreign, federal, or state tax expense. To take advantage of this benefit, we plan to immediately begin repatriating in 2018 and expect to bring back approximately $1."
0,"To maximize our potential in this regard, we need scale within each target node. Critical mass allows us to assemble the right number of retailers, so we can curate an offering that is optimal for the targeted trade area. This results in the assembled group of retailers collectively driving more traffic and overall sales, which we know leads to higher rent growth."
0,"To recap, we were able to leverage our channel management strategy with these sites to ensure that we retain all previously reported fuel volumes. To retain volume in EBITDA will allow us to achieve our target leverage and coverage goals. With, that I will turn the call over to Tom."
0,"To the extent some of it came through to the bottom line, that would be good for shareholders. We feel confident about our results, which is why we increased the dividend by 24%. I was actually kind of disappointed that none of the early stuff when we wrote about the 24%, I'm like, hey, what happened to the dividend?"
0,"To unlock the full potential of these high converting leads, we are working on the next-generation of monetization features. We are focused on better matching consumers with businesses, and are exploring a take rate product that will allow us to participate in the gross merchandise value running through Request-A-Quote. In summary, our team's focused execution helped us finish the year in a position of strength."
0,"To us, what matters is consistent multiyear growth in per-share results, while maintaining a conservative balance sheet, not headline growth in our asset base. This approach to creating shareholder value allows us to be highly selective in our acquisitions and positions us to perpetuate our long-term track record of a consistent core FFO per share growth, with less execution risk and more focus on quality real estate. Second, not all retail is toxic."
0,"Today approximately 60% of our portfolio is well located in the GTA with another 22% in the Montreal region. This focus allows us to capitalize on very strong fundamentals in these markets. Both are experiencing low availability and vacancy rates, with absorption outpacing new supply, as well as recapturing increasing operating efficiencies and economies of scale."
0,"Today, if you look at finance and IT, we have a lot of huge offshore footprint than we had about two years ago. What it allows us to do is, as we go and acquire companies, it allows us to scale at a much lower cost base. We also looked at SE restructuring, looking at unprofitable product lines, exiting those uncomfortable product lines, looking at driving sales efficiency."
0,"Typically, Smart TV purchasers are more towards the front-end of the technology adoption curve. And being on a set-top box from an operator allows us to be in the place where a lot of folks are consuming linear TV, more traditional and catching a little bit more of the later adopter. And then making it super easy for them to sign up by just actually adding Netflix to their bill or even more what we're looking at now is packaging Netflix into one of those operator offerings so they just get it as part of a bundle that they are purchasing for the operator."
0,"was established to be the future operational hub for Nuvo's ex-Canadian business and to hold our EU marketing authorizations within an EU member state. In November, we received Toronto Stock Exchange approval to proceed with a normal course issuer bid that allows us to use our existing cash to buy back Nuvo common shares. We believe that Nuvo shares are currently undervalued."
0,"We actually look for productivity gains. And that allows us to drive smart cost cutting. So, yeah, I think CHF 400 million is it."
0,"We added significant talent to the organization in 2017, and we'll continue to invest in people and technology. As we have stated on prior calls, we believe strongly that a conservative capital structure will allow us to remain opportunistic regarding acquisitions and other investments that can support innovation and growth. Finally, we intend to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends, and when market conditions are appropriate, share repurchases."
0,"We also have remaining debt capacity under the Deerfield agreement, the majority of which we can access after we've achieved a specific historical sales run rate. In addition, we recently filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC, which will allow us to provide timely and efficient access to the capital markets should we decide to issue securities in the future. slide 21 addresses 2018."
0,"We also provided you with our targets for 2018, announcing at the same time that we have implemented an organizational consolidation of our sales, marketing and distribution activities. This will allow us to better leverage our go-to-market capabilities, and drive operational efficiencies across the front end of our business. We'll cover this later, but first, let me take you through some details on our fourth quarter results."
0,We also reduced a portion of our valuation allowance and recorded a benefit of $66. 4 million due to changes under the Act that will allow us to realize more of our deferred tax assets going forward. We also recorded a benefit of $105.
0,"We also took the decision of moving away from the Panettone business in the Brazil business which impacted our sales. But in the long run, we feel confident that we made the right decision. So, all in all, that business is very much in transition but it's heading in the right direction."
0,"We always have a preference in terms of investing in the business and certainly making sure that before we do invest in the business, that we expect those opportunities to be attractive in terms of returns for our shareholders. And so when we see opportunities, we have plenty of flexibility to pursue those, and that's our first priority. Fortunately, we can also continue to return cash to shareholders."
0,"We apply it year after year. We consolidate our long-term debt, so we have an average duration of close to six years, while it's reducing the rate, which is magical because only we should increase the rate when we extend the maturity, but it costs us less, because we have our policy without being aggressive allows us to leverage the differential between long-term and short-term debt. And so, the proportion of the debt with a variable rate, 53% once related to net debt because cash surpluses is any of the third."
0,We are a test and learn company. We've got a price optimization tool that allows us to look at elasticity and we will do just that.
0,"We are also equally if not more bullish in the midstream situation in CPA. We feel that since we were the first mover on the upstream side, we have a significant opportunity to be the first mover in the   sorry, the first mover on the upstream side, we have the ability to be the first mover on the midstream side as well, not only for CNX's production but for third-parties surrounding us. This chart shows the base production that's in our current plan and I'd like to point out that there is a lot of room for upside based on the well information or acreage that we have around here, both above the volume projections here and beyond 2022, from both our assets and others in the area."
0,"We are committed to aggressively growing our off-premise business. We will measure ourselves against the best-in-class in our business, not just casual dining, on everything from team member engagement to guest satisfaction to traffic growth, and we will set ourselves up for the model changes needed that will allow us to grow again in the future. With that, let's all turn to Guy for the details on Q4 2017 year end, and our 2018 outlook, or as we know it around here the annual \\""""Guydance."
0,"We are confident that our investment in infrastructure will continue to pay off, allowing us to capture additional opportunities. Also, our strong balance sheet will allow us to execute on our strategy of facilitating engagement and delivering major projects through multiple top tier operators. Now, moving onto the results of the fourth quarter."
0,"We are continuing to work on non-core asset sales in 2018 to further reduce debt. As we said before, our goal is to create flexibility that allows us to realize the value of our assets and reduce our total debt over time. We have further to go, but we've already taken critical steps in 2018 to create additional runway."
0,"We are forecasting adjusted EBITDA to be between $320 million and $330 million. We also expect to generate positive free cash flow during 2018, with capital expenditures between $190 million and $210 million as we continue to invest where we see opportunities to gain or maintain market share. Interest payments are expected to be between $115 million and $125 million."
0,"We are fully compliant with all of our debt covenants and have plenty of room under our financial covenants to add additional debt for acquisitions without any issues. All of this, as well as the flexibility built into our debt agreement, allows us to take advantage of more and larger acquisitions that makes it easy for us to complete them quickly. During the first nine months of this year, depreciation and amortization totaled approximately $36."
0,"We are genuinely appreciative of the support from those who spoke from the analyst community and from investors over the course of the quarter, and beyond that we're going to be here for the long-term, making the donuts and hopefully delivering these kind of results quarter-after-quarter as best we can. And as long as we do that, we feel confident that you'll stick with us, and that really gives us a lot of energy. So, thank you, and we'll talk to some of you soon and talk to everyone again in a couple of months when it's a little sunnier."
0,"We are going to do some facility expansion next year, so we're projecting our 2018 capital expenditures, again excluding the capitalized software, to be about $40 million. We did note the tax rates in our earnings release, as well as in conversation with Dennis and it is due to the Tax Cut and Job Act (sic) [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act], but it's also due to the adoption of the new accounting standards that we adopted earlier this year, which allows us to report the tax benefit of stock options exercises in our calculation of income tax spend. That accounting standard will continue into next year; and as a result, our effective tax rate will most likely fluctuate quarter-to-quarter."
0,"We are more alpha, we can be more selective. We have a smaller book and that allows us to expect higher growth rate   pace for the credit portfolio this year."
0,"We are now a solid diversified businesses with near double-digit growth. We have a strong balance sheet that allows us to search for attractive M&A opportunity like we demonstrated with the Nanosphere acquisition, while we remain focused on building shareholder value. This ends our formal comments."
0,"We are still loss-making, but at single digit. I think the positive news there is we are able to generate cash flows despite the loss situation, which in turn means, of course, we have reduced inventories, which allows us to generate positive cash flow. We have started to reduce inventories, I think, ahead of the industry, which now benefits us."
0,"We became one of a very few set of organizations in the country to receive all of the Medicare data from the federal government. This data allows us to see precisely which patients need which benefit and precisely which providers are best suited to serve them. The ABILITY Network allows us to address exactly those providers or exactly those patients in a way that does not exist in the marketplace today, unlocking the value of the billions of dollars of reserve payment opportunity from the federal government for a cohort of patients that today receive very little oversight from the systems that our ecosystem provides for them."
0,"We believe strongly that you measure the quality of a real estate investment based on your ability to drive growth, and that all begins with getting better tenants at better rents. What is it about this environment that allows us to drive this outperformance? I believe that there are three primary factors."
0,"We believe that a large part of our members will work out with our app on their mobile device in one way or the other within the next few years. This will allow us to reach most of our members directly at their mobile and communicate with them. In the short-term, we will encourage the use of our app by enabling members to use free Wi-Fi through the app, and we will enable members to access our club with the app."
0,"We believe the time is right for this, more given the Sucampo acquisition and other transactions of last year. We are fulfilling our strategy and the move, then ultimate disposal of non-core assets, will allow us to fully shift our focus to our innovative portfolio of marketed and development brands. As you'll see in the press release, we have published historical net sales for the new continuing operations of the company as we anticipate presenting them in the first quarter of 2018."
0,"We believe this has given us a strategic advantage in this segment of the market as we are increasingly able to meet the full borrowing need of our clients. This in turn provides higher certainty of execution to our borrowers and allows us to win deals without sacrificing our underwriting standards. We believe that our track record is a result of our sourcing, diligence and loan management capabilities."
0,"We believe this level of dividend represents a prudent amount, which can sustained for the foreseeable future with plenty of room to grow it over time as we continue to increase earnings. Importantly, it still allows us to retain ample cash to continue investing in the business to foster future growth. We've also been buying back our stock, acquiring another 111,000 shares during the fourth quarter, bringing our total share repurchases for 2017 to 339,000 shares at a weighted average price of $47."
0,"We both continued to have   and continue to have high customer service scores, however, as we all know customer service as a journey and we as a leadership team are committed to continue to build the resident-centric culture. The Invitation Homes' vision is to continuously enhance the resident living experience and our new scale will allow us to get to that vision quicker. We have many thousands of families in our homes and now we can provide even more expanded housing options and choice."
0,"We can also be responsive to market disruption. So if we have a disruption in one region, we can bring product from another region, allows us to be a more reliable supplier to our customers. So we're very unique in terms of this overall global supply chain, it's been building up over many, many decades, underpins our growth plans going forward."
0,"We can better assess customer income and on and off with a tap with greater accuracy. That allows us to better customize and tailor-made our credit products for each of our customers. With that, I conclude our prepared remarks."
0,"We continue to deliver our intelligence-led advanced solutions to security mature enterprises, and we compete in a more price-sensitive mid-market while offering compelling economics for our channel partners. Our innovation allows us to simplify our go-to-market strategies on multiple fronts including pricing, packaging, and messaging. Our new Chief Marketing Officer, Vasu Jakkal, and her team are laser-focused on simplifying our messaging and getting the FireEye story out to our customers, partners, and our prospects."
0,"We continue to evaluate the best approach to issuing equity publicly, including the use of equity forwards. That strategy will allow us to deploy equity at the right time for regulatory purposes. And again, I'd underscore that any new public equity contemplated in our plan has been reflected in our EPS growth targets."
0,"We continue to evaluate the impact of the Tax Act to our business and we'll provide an update when we report our fourth quarter results. As we move forward, our strategy is to continue improving operating performance with a focus on driving net sales, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, which will allow us to pay down debt. We continue to feel good about our ability to deliver operationally-driven improvements to our balance sheet."
0,"We continue to position the company to be modestly asset sensitive. And so, as part of our assumptions that we outlined in our 10-K this year, it shows a little bit more asset sensitivity because we've assumed and included in there the assumption as far as a lower betas for the next couple of rate increases, which allows us to show a little bit more asset sensitivity."
0,"We continue to seek to out license this product for commercialization in Japan and with favorable outcome to advance its clinical development in the United States. We view this CLBS12 study in Japan as a potentially rapid entry point to the market and the basis to explore the broader applicability of CD34 therapy, which could offer us significant opportunities across multiple underserved cardiovascular indications. Moving on to our CD34 program as a treatment for CMD."
0,"We converted to a single loyalty program for customers and single HR, finance and payroll systems in the back of the house. We've received a single operating certificate from the FAA, a herculean effort that allows us to operate Alaska and Virgin America as one airline and which is also a prerequisite for other merger-related activities like the PSS cut-over. We've made all aircraft delivery and interior decisions, and our first Airbus airplane came out of the paint shop yesterday with new Alaska colors."
0,"We could provide different examples, but the one you see in the bottom of this page may be the most significant example of how strong Barcelona has been is our building in Parc GlÃ²ries, which is to be delivered by the end of this year. We had already pre-let in the past 40% of this building to Schibsted, now it is also public that we have leased another 50% of   40% of this building to King, which is a very well-known American company listed in the Nasdaq, which allows us to have, as of today, 80% of this building pre-let. That's the only substantial REIT left that we had in Barcelona."
0,"We currently expect and are planning for the investment environment to remain very competitive with high asset prices. And while it is difficult to predict what our actual level of deployment will be in any given year, we have confidence that our global platform of 650 investment professionals across 31 offices will allow us to invest wisely and deploy responsibly across cycles. Moving on to the second thought I'd like to highlight."
0,"We currently have over 120 million names in that database. And one of our key objectives is to leverage that data and recruiting the talent that allows us to obviously think about how we can not only approach consumers more directly in a more customized manner, but also in terms of how we think about leveraging machine learning for the inventory management process internally. These are all areas that we're having discussions on and working on right now, so a very exciting space indeed."
0,"We do that with 11 R&D/technical centers spread across seven countries. What's important about that is you have to do those applications close to the customers' facilities and this allows us to do it. And our technology is protected by a very active   over 800 active patents, a third of our revenue today is from those active patents."
0,"We don't have any of those sensors really built in. And so either by getting better data from mapping systems or by gradually building in those data feeds, that would be the things that I think ultimately allows us to have rapid, reproducible, reliable automation."
0,"We don't have the interchange caps the way a lot of the other debit networks do as a result of that. So, we actually have the ability to collect an interchange rate that allows us to payout that reward and allows us to continue to build upon that relationship."
0,"We don't know what's happening with oil and what does it mean for freight and warehousing. So I would say we feel confident about the current guides of $200 million to $250 million and that internal forecast has now been stable for several weeks or months, but I would be lying to you if I wouldn't say there's uncertainty on the raw material side because we just see the inflation trends creeping in on many parts of our value chain."
0,"We ended the year with $94 million in cash and decreased our net debt by over 30%. And we fully funded the initial payments on two acquisitions and announced a significant divestiture that will allow us to focus on our core products. Before I turn to our net sales results for the quarter, I want to provide an update on our Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement or TMVR clinical trials and discuss our recent announcement regarding our intent to purchase TandemLife."
0,"We estimate the addressable market for Zio AT to be roughly 10% of the total available ambulatory monitoring market or roughly 400,000 tests per year. While the opportunity is relatively small when compared to that of Zio XT, the offering allows us to fill an important unmet market need for our customers. Zio AT is receiving strong physician and patient feedback, chief among the benefits are a high degree of clinical accuracy obtained through uninterrupted continuous monitoring, strong patient compliance enabled by our patented wearable design, and a significant reduction in the number of over notifications that are often present with alternative approaches."
0,"We expect LOXO-292 will be the subject of a Phase 1 update at the medical meeting in the first half of 2018, either AACR or ASCO. We will provide details on this specific meeting once we have an accepted abstract and the meeting allows us to talk about it. If you recall, we dosed the first patient in May 2017."
0,"We expect OI&E to be about 300 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 15%. Tax reform will allow us to pursue a more optimal capital structure for our company. Our current net cash position is $163 billion and given the increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our foreign cash, we are targeting to become approximately net cash neutral over time."
0,We expect this to give us a $0. 10 per share benefit to EPS and allows us to increase our full-year EPS guidance now to a range of $3 to $3. 10 per share.
0,"We expect to have additional gathering infrastructure in place by the middle of next year. They will get us around that constraint, which will allow us to begin growing that production again and grow into that capacity. And that wraps it up for marketing."
0,"We expect to receive and deploy the remaining $60 million of debentures under our SBIC license during 2018. These improvements taken in total to our capital base will allow us to grow investment portfolio to more than $500 million. Now, asset quality."
0,We feel confident in that.
0,"We feel confident we executed. I think when we did the last roadshow at the end of the year showing what our track record has typically been, we feel confident that we'll be able to achieve that synergies. Stephanie gave a little bit more color on timing."
0,We feel confident we'll be around that 15%.
0,We feel like that's a better position for us. It will allow us to weather cycles of energy prices going forward regardless of where they might move. So we feel like that headwind has subsided quite a bit.
0,"We feel like we've got the right strategy in place. Certainly, we have a good capital structure that allows us to be successful or, if you will, our house is in order, and we feel that we can execute on that. The stock price is the stock price."
0,"We feel pretty good about the ability to continue driving the leverage that we've talked about, and in light of both that dynamic from land versus expand and given the 25-plus-percent sales force growth, over the past year we're still able to put up a few percentage points of leverage in sales and marketing. And so a lot of the other trends that we're seeing and the things we're doing to drive efficiencies and sales force productivity we think will get us there and allows us to continue to drive that leverage in the coming years."
0,"We feel the company we are buying has great people, a highly qualified and dedicated workforce and a great list of clients. Our decision to buy the whole company allows us to move quickly to preserve customer relationships and backlog, retain key personnel and workforce, and begin building from a solid base. We have a clear path to completion which we expect to be in the second quarter of this year and we've been working closely with Willbros' corporate team to reach this agreement and expect this to be a smooth transition for their stakeholders."
0,"We got the benefits that I mentioned, but you've seen at least an impact in EBITDA and free cash flow in 2018. We also made it clear that recycling the Dublin capital allows us to grow free cash flow substantially by the mid-2020s and we've put a number on that today, right, so the $250 million in free cash flow. I talked a little bit about the levers we'll pull before the UK projects come on."
0,"We have a lot of resources deployed with our customers. We have a tremendous customer service framework that allows us to be in direct contact with our customers, understanding their needs, helping them solve problems throughout the day, helping them manage their logistics within their premises and within their boundaries. There's a lot of things that we do in terms of services that create a lot of stickiness with our customers."
0,"We have a mature auditing and monitoring systems, but we are constantly looking for new ways to improve our risk sensing capabilities. To this end, we have just launched a new pilot initiative that will allow us to obtain real-time information on supply chain issues from the factory floor. This creative pilot is based on the idea that HP's best results in addressing supply chain labor, health and safety issues is our own people."
0,"We have a really strong portfolio of brands, and they are at an early stage. So, we feel confident in saying that we see more than 25% growth for 2018, and from the years from 2019 to 2022 per year. So, that was a little bit   and then we have the new initiatives."
0,"We have a strong relationship with our brokers and have a successful model, which has been in operation for a number of years. This allows us to extend our customer reach. We thank the broker community for their continued support."
0,"We have been an acquisitive company over time. We think we've got a proven acquisition track record over that timeframe, and then finally a repeat on the business model, it's a strong cash flow generator that allows us to invest not only organically back into the business, inorganically, and then buyback, stock buyback as well."
0,"We have been maintaining a highly liquid position with 49% of total assets comprised of cash and equivalents, short-term investments and investment assets. Our liquidity allows us to strategically invest in higher-yielding securities as the rate environment improves. Average deposit balances of $9."
0,We have generated the preclinical data for the five combination dose actually for the continuous dose cohorts and the process is in place for FDA approval prior to the fourth combination dose. So we feel confident about that.
0,"We have one leader for each work streams and we have one sponsor for these work streams at the management committee level of the group. As you can see, we have articulate a very detailed savings plan, which will allow us to reduce our cost base by â‚¬450 million at the end of 2020. We have organized this program with six work streams rightsizing mature business, capacity and planning, shared service, country support functions, real estate, and external spend."
0,"We have pretty high thresholds, typically it's a 25% plus type IRR that we're seeking, but, it depends on what other attributes the acquisition brings to the table. If we can accelerate unit growth, and that's a very undervalued component of our acquisition strategy for taking out a competitor, that allows us to enjoy some pretty significant EBITDA optimization, that's another consideration. But as Steve mentioned, I mean, we walk away from nine transactions for every one that we do, but the pipeline is strong, given where valuations have been, given the inflow of capital into this vertical, there seems to be more and more operators reassessing their outlook and trying to make a determination of can they monetize future value today at a level if they otherwise would not have been able to, and we're seeing more companies on the market as a result."
0,"We have quite a bit of cash trapped offshore. That will allow us to bring all that cash back. So, very positive from a Biogen perspective, for U."
0,"We have seen evidence that as other organizations underwriting action begin to match their tough words at the top, the market overall strengthens its determination to be paid fairly for the risks that we assume. In sum, as regarding rate   as regards rate it is early, but we like what we are seeing; it matches us well and allows us to accelerate our strategic journey as we shift our profit engine into higher gear. So all in, a tough year."
0,We have some research collaborations and exploiting those capabilities. And what that allows us to do is agnostically identify what are the best combinations to address an area of unmet need for a novel target development. We then   and that's where we think the major differentiation is.
0,We have Sucupira and Baru at the pit perimeter. How do we do a push back of that pit that allows us to be able to capture some of those higher grades that we reported in our results into through our plant? The second is Suruca as a complex.
0,"We have system-level engineering capabilities, I think, second to none. And that allows us to work well with all of these different card integrators and different parts of the ecosystem to give absolutely optimized solution at the optimized cost. And right now, what we've been doing is building out the sales and marketing team, bringing in people from the card ecosystem who know how to take our products to market."
0,"We have the widest spreads in the net lease space. We have a cost of capital today that allows us to go buy assets and acquire assets that are frankly trophies like Secaucus. But at the same time, we're focused on individual value creation across all three of our origination platforms."
0,"We have to say that we find that very attractive, so from a business perspective, this is really attractive. From a development perspective, this allows us to get a readout very early on in terms of biomarkers to demonstrate that we actually affect the right biomarkers also in humans. And then hopefully later on, we can also move into the more challenging diseases, but where there is clearly a significant unmet medical need."
0,"We impact tens of thousands of families annually through the work that we do in these communities. But it also allows us to get the highest quality essential oils that no one else can do. 86%, I think of our essential oils are sourced uniquely to doTERRA."
0,"We increased our dividend 9% in 2017. And in 2018, subject to board approval, we intend to increase our dividend 15% to 18%, which will allow us to hit the high-end of our goal of distributing 30% to 35% of earnings to our shareholders. Okay."
0,"We know from our Phase 3 study that the benefit of every other week was extremely high, and we know that there is also a weight relationship in ApoC-III reduction. And so, we think the fact that this is the only drug available for these patients, the fact that it is working, allows us to manage all this and to price effectively as well. With inotersen, we don't have the background platelet declines that are disease-related in FCS."
0,"We know that we've also benefited from a number of the programs that we've put in place in the second half of last year to drive additional organic growth, and they're starting to take hold. So we feel confident in our outlook for the year. And the other thing, as I'd like to highlight, is that, as Rob mentioned in his prepared remarks, we have different accounting standards for the pension this year."
0,"We know when they return the kit, we know whether Cologuard was positive or negative, we know whether our reps have called on those doctors. So, that data allows us to do everything from what Kevin said drill into individual ordering trends per provider. It lets us design targets, right, who are the most promising targets for our reps to call on, who are the targets that maybe need a little more nudging from our inside reps?"
0,"We like some predictable volumes. It allows us to plan much better, and as I mentioned, invest our capital in a much more disciplined way, tie up our resources, or allocate resources in a more prudent fashion. Now, not all markets can be predictable, but what we're looking for kind of short term as to building some commitments with customers to either commit on a certain level of volumes or have a take-or-pay arrangement where they would pay damages if they didn't meet those minimum volumes, and kind of put some skin in the game on both sides."
0,We look forward to benefiting from future strong film products. We are in the early execution phase in a number of diversification initiatives and our balance sheet allows us to continue to invest in these growth initiatives to deliver future value for our shareholders. That concludes our remarks for this morning and we would now like to turn the call over to the conference operator for questions.
0,"We matched those after that to a group of 8 normal subjects in terms of their renal function. We had a 48-hour pharmacodynamic period, followed by a 60-day follow-up period to will allow us to assess the wash out of inclisiran in these patients as per all normal trials, with a 180-day final period for this trial. Clearly from the data it supports no dose adjustment in mild, moderate or even severe renal impairment."
0,"We may bump out our wash alley and make it even larger, and that will add capacity. And we usually do those things as we start to creep up on the capacity and that allows us to expand the existing capacity. We'll continue to do those things we have in the last several years."
0,"We mentioned that we've got another 170,000 homes this quarter that we've got bundled with wireless and there 700,000 wireless customers that were bundled with our satellite TV product. That bundling allows us to have profitability from that combined account. It also   it creates higher value, lifetime value for each of those customers."
0,"We never built them. And so, we're not as exposed to them, and it allows us to then be a lot more progressive in the sort of offerings we offer our clients, because we're not disrupting ourselves."
0,"We put all the support circuitry underneath the array and that enables us to have the die size smaller. So, not only did we choose a technology that allows us to get the apartments smaller, if you will, but it also enables us to get the parking lot underneath as well. And then, also long term, we chose technology that we think will do well for adding more bits per cell, if you will."
0,"We remain committed to executing fixed-rate, long-term financings. These two shelf agreements will allow us to issue additional senior unsecured notes to the investors at terms to be agreed upon at the time of any issuance. At year-end, no notes had been issued under the shelf agreements."
0,We saw mid-single digit volume growth in West Texas. The commission agent model allows us to continue to participate in the turnaround in growth in this area. Q4 wholesale volumes is 1.
0,We saw mid-single-digit volume growth in West Texas. The commission agent model allows us to continue to participate in the turnaround in growth in this area. Q4 wholesale volumes was 1.
0,"We saw them at CES is what we call the home gateways or hotspots. And so a home gateway or hotspot which can be no bigger than the size of a hockey puck, receives that ATSC signal into the home, and everybody in this room will be able to watch ATSC television because it's then rebroadcast over the Wi-Fi connection in the room, and so that allows us to be able to leverage the scale of all the devices that are already out there. There are smart app-based devices, whether their iOS or Android or whatever and we've done our demonstrations on Amazon fireboxes and video shields, Samsung tablets, iOS iPads."
0,"We see Internet traffic beginning to reaccelerate at a faster pace. And we feel confident that that business will return to its historical average. We're not ready to predict what quarter that is, but I think investors should see both the continuous progress we made throughout last year at an accelerating rate into 2018."
0,"We see the spring, summer garments are appreciated. So, we feel confident in that. When it comes to buying more in season and having better flexibility, our commitment today, commitment to buy is lower than last year."
0,"We should be compensated by higher loan volume and by tighter funding spreads. And then the customer rate level will stabilize and then the higher loan volume will allow us to grow the NII. Mirko, I'll let you comment on the â‚¬36 million."
0,"We stay ahead of the curve because we also want to be very careful in increasing capacity at a steady rate as opposed to in big step changes when suddenly you need to do it because then the performance doesn't come through. So, we want to steadily build capacity through the year, hire the right people, train them so that they're liquidating at our high expectations, which in turn allows us to get the high returns that I talked about."
0,"We still have a couple that have to be completed, finish up the reports and then get that to the FDA as soon as possible, so thus far we've had no showstoppers and we are very happy with the drug product so far, but again there is no guarantee that everything is going to be perfect. There is no guarantee that FDA will allow us to go back in, but based on what we see now, we feel really good about the drug product that we've made and it really looks superior to our earlier drug products and the fact that we hope, we can get back into the clinic soon and get off of."
0,"We think about   the message that's really resonated with them has been the improved audience and engagement, the better ad formats and improved relevance, which have led to better ROI. The sales execution, which is just making sure that we're out telling the story and that we're measuring the success and impact that we're having with advertisers, has had a big difference and that's one of the things that's led to our confidence that allows us to make 2018 a year where we invest to grow at Twitter. It does bring to mind something else, Brent, which I should just share."
0,"We think that it's about enabling sort of the buildup of these sort of end-to-end solutions for our clients. And in doing so, what we haven't done is to go out and sort of buy out a particular horizontal area, whether that being technology or marketing or operations but rather think about what are the components that we need to be able to plug into our overarching business model that allows us to bring this ability to both envision, shape, prototype, build and operate solutions for our customers and enable a journey for them. So we think of it   as we think of the iceberg as an example, a lot of the noise you hear, a lot of the hype you hear about digital has been about above the water line it seems to be about how marketing is changing or how our business is changing or how   it's mostly about the outcomes."
0,"We think we've got that locked down. The addition of these personnel will allow us to go out and challenge that notion and learn it from the ground up all over again, which we intend to do. And as we learn about the demand that's out there that will be useful to us, but more importantly is their mission to go out and educate about the disease state awareness."
0,"We try very hard to be gender-neutral, and 45% of our customers are women. We believe the broad menu, the nicer build-out, being more gender-neutral focused allows us to do more family business. Women, as we all know, make more of the decisions in dining out, especially at dinnertime, and we generate half of our revenue in the evening, so we're a 50/50 split lunch to dinner."
0,"We typically don't make commentary on any given state and so I won't comment on Arizona, but the ability to address these complex populations is typically expressing itself through long-term support services, RFPs and bids, MLTCs such as in New York, and we see this as a continuing trend. It's a very underpenetrated market with what we think is a pretty significant opportunity for the future. So we will continue to evaluate these states and the RFP process and respond accordingly."
0,"We understand the importance of it. We understand what it does in terms of focus and it allows us to innovate back in our brands and our products, and that's important to both consumers and customers. So, when you look at how we've created value and able to take pricing doing the things that we're doing, a lot of it stems back to having that story for the trade to get them excited about the category."
0,"We want to become less capital-intensive. Being able to compete and win in BAW allows us to be more selective in our portfolio, since it's the most important driver to our business improving going forward. So you heard us in the last call, not deemphasized SAW, but acknowledged that our capital and design resources are going to favor BAW versus SAW."
0,"We want to maintain a conservative capital structure, so that's been important to us and will continue to be important. It gives us flexibility and allows us to be opportunistic, and we're kind of targeting like a 1 times to 1. 5 times debt-to-EBITDA."
0,"We want to make good business decisions. And I think what you see with the strength of RCA and really the breadth of our portfolio allows us to have that diversification. Certainly, RowdMap allows us to do more things and work with our clients to add more value, and I think we'll continue to assess and we have these relationships, what else can we do to help our clients succeed."
0,"We will be filing for the relevant state, shareholder and federal approvals as soon as practicable and as you see outlined. Given the benefits for all of our stakeholders and the complementary nature of our operations, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on this timeline. To summarize on slide 23, we believe this is an outstanding step forward for SJW Group and Connecticut Water as well as for our shareholders, our customers, our employees and communities."
0,We will continue to delever until our gross number goes to 4. 25 times which then allows us to take all of the excess cash sitting at the operating company and move it to the holding company which is the entity that can do both stock buybacks and dividends. Today we have about $70 million up at holdco and we have $180 million in opco.
0,"We will continue to invest in the Customer First agenda. We think that allows us to deliver sustainable position, including the sustainable NIM of 2. 40%-plus and deliver the cost income ratio as we continue to get head count reductions and efficiency benefits."
0,"We will continue to invest in the sales team going forward as the 2017 results show it's one of the best ways to grow our business. Moving on to slide 8, our exceptional results for 2017 has established Tecogen as a profitable and self-sustaining business that will allow us to continue investing in future growth. A key indicator of our ability to sustain momentum is our backlog, which stood at $15."
0,"We will continue to offer targeted experiential events around our audiences' passion points like sports and music. We believe these enhancements in our advertising offerings will allow us to engage with CMOs that are not currently advertising with Univision. We will continue to prioritize the growth of subscriber revenue and work towards ensuring our content is distributed everywhere content can be consume, and we will expand our investments in our own direct-to-consumer platform Univision Now."
0,"We will push additional deleverage while we improve return on capital employed. This will allow us to maintain a solid balance sheet and investment grade credit rating. Regarding the dividend, we are maintaining a stable and sustainable amount of â‚¬0."
0,"We'd be doing lot more buybacks. My preference would be probably a combination of if we have new technologies we can bring in that are solving problems from our customers and allows us to grow a greenfield. Ideally if we have the people to do it that that's the most dependable returns you can get, it takes time."
0,"We'll continue to work on our $20 million productivity and efficiency initiatives. We feel confident in achieving that goal by year end as planned. In closing, our 2017 company results were better than those of 2016 and became more encouraging as the year progressed, in spite of the fact that we had to recognize some unusual expenses in the Plant Nutrient and Grain Groups."
0,"We'll likely expand in a Phase 1 expenditure some of our liquid and extract capability towards the end of this year. And there, the idea is we do the building works, the utilities and infrastructure works that allows us to get through the next nine months and further refine our forecast of growth in that area. But, having done that preparatory work, it literally is just the time then to order the equipment and install it into a building with utilities and everything ready."
0,"We'll stay sensitive to competitive forces in the marketplace, but we do not expect this benefit to be competed away. Our commitment to cost discipline, modern IT delivery through managed services and outcome-based contracting will allow us to lower costs for our government customers even as we defend our margins. The additional cash that we generate will further drive earnings and shareholder returns through our balanced capital allocation plan."
0,"We'll then work with participants to agree an implementation schedule. This will inform us on CapEx timing and size, and this will allow us to update you in August as we normally do for the following year or FY 2019's overall CapEx. So with that, I'll now hand over to Peter to talk about the businesses in more detail."
0,"Well there are things you can't quantify in QFPS synergy statement, but you just can't do and you can't really get there until you get the business. And you're right, yes, we've had experience of doing that and we feel confident we know how to go about that. But to be clear, whilst we are focused on that, and we will be speedy, I think, in the way in which we go about it, in no way, shape or form, are we looking at this combination through the lens of the synergy gain."
0,"Well we   so, I used to be involved in Availity when I was at Humana. Availity fundamentally is a pipe, and what it allows us to do with the talks that allows payers and providers to talk to each other and very quickly and easily have the payers build in rules, so that they can adjudicate claims without getting people involved. And so, we've looked at how   for us part of taking managed care business, part of the problem has been that's a manual process."
0,"Well, a lot of it's going to depend on what the regulatory environment allows us to do. But regardless of that, we're going to continue to look at again variety of products, variety of brands that are going to resonate with the various segments that we've identified and that we can continue to sort of compete against."
0,"Well, I feel that diversity in channels of distribution has been something that we have always had in our strategy and we'll continue to have a strategy that diversity, product brand and customers are very, very important. As we've seen, retailers over the last 24 months, depending on which channel it has been, has had its challenges, and being able to have the diversity that we have doesn't insulate us 100%, but allows us to have the relationships and the diversity to be able to call on other channels of distribution. So we feel that that's a positive."
0,"Well, I mean, there will be   yeah, there will be a volume impact and offset by strong price and mix that overall we feel confident in that low-single digit revenue growth. Clearly, there will be the implication from an accounting perspective of grossing up for the sugar tax in both revenue and COGS."
0,"Well, I would say, Ian, that we've got a clear roadmap from the FDA in terms of what they'd like to see for us before making the request. We feel confident in our ability to address these questions and we've given the FDA a timeline for us to do that, which is how we derived a Q2 submission for the pre-BLA meeting. So, we know what's in front of us."
0,"Well, it basically allows us to deliver more complete solutions which effectively translates into more of the bill of materials, so, as opposed to delivering a die, we're delivering a completely encapsulated solution to the customer. So, it increases our share of the bill of materials."
0,"Well, it's a great question and you're absolutely right. Our US Oncology footprint allows us to   across the board in oncology, whether they're US Oncology physicians or just open market kind of oncologists by the way who are continuing to be attracted to our US Oncology model. And frankly, with some of the legislative changes that have happened recently or I should say, regulatory changes that have happened recently, we may see even more oncologists returning to the community."
0,"Well, so Frank, what we do is we   Thomas and I sit together and we kind of look at where the current share price is, what's our expectation for cash flow and we set up a grid that again allows us to accomplish our objective of being opportunistic. And then, we let that run its course."
0,"Well, thank you very much, JosÃ© Ignacio. Thank you for the discipline for keeping to the timetable that allows us to have plenty of room for plenty of time rather for Q&A. So if you have any questions, please if you are going to ask them, please state your name and the company you work at."
0,"Well, the major swing factors in both those businesses really have to do with new product launches that have just recently launched at the end of 2017 and are about ready to launch in 2018, and the rate at which those are adopted. We think we've found that range to be an appropriate range, we believe that we feel confident we'll be within, but taking all that into consideration."
0,"Well, what I said during 2017 is we would pay a dividend commensurate with how we feel about risk, capital, concentrations and earnings. And going into 2018, also given all the constructive work and accomplishments of 2017, that we feel confident now initiating that $0. 10 dividend, and we'll evaluate what level that dividend should be as we progress through 2018."
0,"We're actually hoping to do better than the second half and I'll tell you why, because we   first of all, there's no turnaround this year and the work we are doing allows us to push turnaround further up, so that's one thing. Second, we're hoping to run Big Spring as Big Spring was running in the last few months at 70,000 barrels per day and we're hoping to get it up to 73,000 barrels per day."
0,"We're also approaching our business very disciplined today. We're looking to grow at a double-digit pace 10% to 15% each year, at that level of growth it allows us to manage our investments in land and housing such that we can still generate positive cash flow. The last three years we've generated positive annual cash flow from operations, this year we expect to generate over $700 million of operating cash flow, and we're going to continue to approach all of our investments in a disciplined manner to generate positive cash flow."
0,"We're also re-evaluating the number of single-day or single-daypart offers that we have out there. We think that we can consolidate once again into the most powerful ones and make it easier for the restaurants to execute and also will allow us to run the sharper everyday value offers for longer. And last but not least, new product news."
0,"We're confident we can sustain momentum into the coming years. We believe that executing our strategic initiatives will allow us to continue to enhance the customer experience which will, in turn, lead to growth and improved profitability. As such, we'll continue to strive for double-digit EPS growth over the next three years."
0,"We're doing well against that guidance, but we want to actually deliver before we decide we're doing a much larger repurchase program or any other kind of capital return. So, this was modest enough that it allowed us to kind of be conservative and maintain our targets, but meaningful enough that it allows us to go out, manage the share count and be opportunistic if the opportunity to buy back some stock at a good price is there."
0,"We're in advanced discussions in several states and are confident we'll enter a few new markets in the first half of this year. We're also doing early advisory work with several states that could lead to some significant opportunities in 2019 and beyond. Overall, a large and high-growth market for what we do and our growing sophistication in asset base positions us well for expansion into several states with our provider partners."
0,"We're not investing to maintain production. We're investing based on return, the oil that that incremental capital will allow us to get out of the ground itself."
0,"We're not putting it on our balance sheet or finding ways to not expense it. It's in the numbers, which allows us to generate that cash. It's real cash that we can then give out to you and our shareholders."
0,"We're not trying to grow our profits against them, and we're not trying to compete with them in the marketplace to take share from them. And so our focus is on their success, and we think that that focus allows us to make the right decisions and to position the company properly going forward."
0,"We're piloting in 15 stores by the end of this month. Five Life Fitness, five Precor, and five Matrix, which will allow us to actually know the member that's on the treadmill or the bike what have you and know exactly what they're doing, how many minutes, how many miles, pace, and so on, heart rate. So, I think once you start capturing this data from our members, being able to tee this up for the insurance providers that not only going to show you that you're showing up, I can tell you what they're doing."
0,"We're seeing increases in head count productivity metrics, standardizing that in-unit labor model that we talked to you about. I mentioned in my prepared comments about the importance of the demand-driven scheduling and allowing that to flex, flex our labor which allows us to reduce overtime and agency. So if you really look at what's happened from a productivity perspective on labor the last couple of quarters, it's been quite positive for us."
0,"We're seeing volumes on the pressure control side, fluid control business that kind of mirrors the peak of 2014. So, we're pretty hopeful that all of the work that we've done in that business will allow us to see that leverage come through in 2018."
0,"We're sure to do a lot of communities. We open communities, we close communities, and will allow us to stabilize our community count number and more steadily grow that number over the long-term. And the lots are..."
0,"We're therefore also pleased that this transaction will further strengthen our balance sheet position. Based on pro forma 2017 financials, the acquisition allows us to decrease leverage to approximately 2. 6 times net debt to EBITDA."
0,"We're uniquely positioned in the industry to be with end-users potentially 24 hours a day based on the different devices that we can put into their environment. So that capability allows us to provide more useful 24-hour day insights into healthcare data and helps providers be more cost effective in supporting their end users, their customers 24 hours a day. But then, I think as we've seen in all of our consumer lives, there is a tremendous amount of information and utility you get out of Generation 2, 3 and 4 of applications that are on devices you already have."
0,"We're very competitive in K-12. The first part of your question about Gauge, what Gauge does for us is it allows us to respond to more RFPs than we could before. A lot of RFPs had a requirement in them to provide a solution for testing and we simply couldn't play."
0,"We're very disciplined in how we reinvest into the company. We look for very strategic projects that are not driven by the market that will allow us to enhance the overall profitability of the company. And then, our commitments, which I'm going to share in just a minute, the return to shareholders, both in the form of a growing dividend and with our share repurchase program."
0,"We're very excited about where we stand. We have a capacity on the manufacturing side that allows us to get ahead of the expected demand, but it's still very early days of the adoption. There's still a lot to learn."
0,"We're very pleased with where the company is positioned at this point in time, having kept our capability and specialized drilling intact. Coming out of one of the longest downturn in the industry with net cash on hand, allows us to improve our fleet to meet customer's demand in terms of rates, rod handling, mobile equipment and technology, which is key to our success to remain the leader in specialized drilling. Also, having the best equipment and financial resources allows us to attract the best people at a time, when we're going into a labor crunch in our industry."
0,"We've   surprise has always been a weapon that we wanted to use inside Atlassian. We've always wanted to be   have incredibly great ROI and that allows us to have less sales people and less friction in the sales process. If you looked through historical enterprise sale software, not sure if you'll be able to do this today, but, they would say, we've got $100,000 ROI for this product, and I'll sell it to you for the bargain price of $95,000; and you'd have a sales person in that mix trying to argue for it."
0,"We've been investing behind the team. We have north of 100 people focused just on this business away from what all theories, management platform allows us to bring to bear, as a reminder, big loan business, big high-yield business et cetera that helps us drive deal flow for all of this. So I can't tell you that it wasn't hard work last year for the team."
0,"We've come a long way since 2014. We believe we are taking the steps that will allow us to create long-term shareholder value in the years to come. Marty, over to you."
0,"We've done that now. That now allows us to go find the people and doing the holes, where we have holes. I think that if you look at the structure and it's been out, and thinking about, so you could see it, I call it maybe 1."
0,We've got a $200 million authorization. And sort of when we see opportunities that's probably what we'll do in terms of returning capital.
0,"We've got a pretty robust process in place to make sure we hit that. So, we feel confident in our ability to hit that $0. 50, that again will help us fund some of the strategic investments."
0,"We've got a unique business model. It allows us to take advantage of developer mindshare in that virality but in a proprietary software business model, we've underlined a very strong unit economics. And so with that, I think we've got some time for questions in case there are any."
0,"We've got the equipment and we've got some people there. So we're looking to mine some of the capitalized waste, bring that forward somewhat, which allows us to be more efficient with the equipment over the remaining mine life. If we were to defer that, we would end up having to bring more equipment in and hire more people potentially for a three- or four-year period, which is pretty inefficient."
0,"We've increased our content budget for 2018, but it's always a lever that we   we move up and down to try to manage for the result. When we get   so the type of content that we have to create has got to be higher   high volume, lower cost content that gets a number that allows us to differentiate the network and to continue to be a value to advertisers. We don't really have the luxury of throwing a bunch of money into the programming budget and taking creative shots to get a big gigantic hit."
0,"We've integrated our two acquisitions this year, and we have all of the combined data coming out of our core system, so it's always nice to prove out our expectations, and we still have a very asset sensitive balance sheet. We have $3 billion and almost $400 million of like daily repricable loans and investments, primarily loans and primarily driven by LIBOR and prime, but that allows us to really benefit as rates continue to rise. We've really modeled our margin a couple of different ways, with the continued rate hikes and if the December 1 was the last one, what did we expect, because we would   eventually, when rates stop rising, you start to have the deposit side catch up."
0,"What is new from the Analyst Day was that the next generation automation, which is actually a significant step change and really changes our entire operating model and makes it much more efficient for us as well, has now been   we've now received that award and will be going to what's called TRL Level 4 and 5 as a result of that very soon. That now allows us to take that complete package including the access now to the flexible jumpers to be able to move towards our vision as we demonstrated at the Analyst Day."
0,"What Northwest Line does for us is it takes the academia pieces of that and it puts it into all of our training across all of Quanta, as well as what we're doing for the industry when we recruit, when we train new apprentices. It just allows us to expedite what we're trying to accomplish with boots on the ground labor in the field. And it makes us look, feel different and also helps the industry and our clients, because they have the same issues we have."

0,"What we need to do is combine that with the enablement to get a faster ramp, and also to look at the causes of attrition and stem the outflow of people. A combination of both of those things will allow us to get after the ramp just as fast as we can."
0,"What we're finding is that we're getting better pricing, not by stapling the asset with financing but allowing the buyer to put whatever financing they choose on the assets. And again, we have unencumbered the portfolios significantly since joining, so it allows us to execute on that. And knock on wood, our liquidity still seems to be strong and we're still executing at similar levels."
0,"What we're seeing, of course, is that the volume and value of number of digital screens we can get for the same dollar is improving as well. So if the audience capabilities, the structure allows us to keep growing revenue then we'll continue to invest in digital. In terms of the returns, there are no difference to anything that we've outlined in the numerous discussions over the last three years."
0,"What were the odds? But we love that as a potential adjacency for us, applying deep learning concepts, allows us to go from   really, where we focus on is that deterministic space, where you can clearly define a problem. That's what our tools today really do."
0,"What's important about this is that many of those openings were going to be filled by the existing Cars. com sales teams, which will allow us to leverage the established intellectual capital that our team has, transition them to Dealer Inspire to help them ramp that business. And we don't necessarily need to refill those jobs in the Cars sales network."
0,"What's new this year? UK legislative activity will continue to drive transaction volume, competitor exits will allow us to continue to focus on our market share. To position ourselves effectively to take advantage of these, we are focused on technology, operations and expanding our business."
0,"What's probably key about the design of this trial is at day 360, the patients on evolocumab will be switched directly to inclisiran every 180 days for a further three years. This will allow us to compare the efficacy, the safety but also patient reported outcomes of switching from evolocumab to inclisiran to a much less frequent dosing regimen the remainder of this patient's course of therapy. As we're going through the trial   it's an open-label trial so we can see the safety data as it's coming in."
0,"When combined with the lower corporate tax rate, we believe our effective tax rate for the full year of 2018 will be in the low to mid-single digits, keeping in mind that this can vary from quarter-to-quarter. These tax benefit sources will allow us to retain more of our earnings, further augment capital, and continue to grow our brand. Our capital position is very strong exiting 2017, with a total capital ratio of 18."
0,"When we finance the Kite transaction, we had a fairly significant shorter term loan in place that we may accelerate repayment of to some extent. And the reason why we're doing that is not so much the cost of debt as opposed to it allows us to manage our debt to EBITDA ratio a little bit better. So that would be another area of focus."
0,"When we take   the final thing, you can say, when we take these kind of decisions, we only   we always do it in partnership with the retailer, so that we feel confident that there is a support from the retailers and that they really want the service."
0,"When we're outselling to large customers or when Fujitsu or partners are outselling the large customers, we're finding that many of them were more interested in purchasing a buck of identities for a period of time, be it one-year, two-year, maybe even a three-year. This, in turn, allows us to bill for a one-year, two-year period in advance and get an acceleration on the cash flow sometimes ahead of the revenue. If that customer is using our service, in other words, we are hosting the service, then that is a service we're providing   or even if we get paid up-front, we will have to recognize that revenue over the duration of that contract."
0,"When you look at the location in terms of the market and in terms of the scrap availability, we believe that we're going to have a very good logistical advantage in terms of our product and in terms of our scrap supply. So, we feel confident about that investment. In Kankakee, we're in the heart of the market."
0,"While I'm sure that it's a good business and it will be a fundamental part of wireless network deployment over the coming years, we don't deny that that's probably the case, particularly in dense urban areas. It's really a matter of what do we bring to the table that allows us to generate the kind of returns we can get in our macro business. And I'm not sure that if you have assets that are not exclusive in nature, which these are really not, you're in more of an RFP type of business."
0,"While the harsh weather conditions in certain parts of the country presented supply and logistics challenges for many in the industry, I'm extremely proud of the coordination between our field personnel and our supply department to ensure uninterrupted supply to our customer service centers in order to meet customer demand. It is in conditions like these that our size, national presence and strong relationships with suppliers and logistics providers allows us to keep our location adequately supplied in order to effectively manage demand spikes. Mike?"
0,"While there will be some expense synergies over time, this strategic transaction does not require integration savings to enhance AIG's top and bottom lines, and provides an attractive return on investment. Validus' earnings will allow us to accelerate the usage of our existing net operating losses. At this time, we anticipate making a 953(d) election that will make Validus a U."
0,"While we're encouraged by the progress made, a lot more work is needed to sustain and broaden this improvement. We believe the next steps we're taking will allow us to achieve this objective. Until we're confident that we're seeing a sustainable trend, we're maintaining our fiscal 2018 outlook."
0,"With an improved price environment in 2018, we've increased development capital to the $300 million to $325 million range. That will keep us within cash flow and will allow us to progress multiple areas that will continue to grow the company's value. Exploitation spend will increase significantly, reaching $30 million to $40 million across the company."
0,"With our improving business mix, we expect our growth rate to remain conservative in the near term. We feel confident that our underwriting capabilities and we believe we will be profitable in 2018. With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Nick for a breakdown of our individual underwriting markets."
0,"With respect to our extraction capabilities, Nuuvera subsidiary is the only standalone Health Canada GMP-approved facility that is authorized and dedicated under its controlled drugs and substances license to conduct commercial scale activities with respect to cannabis and also cannabinoids. We have a state-of-the-art medical laboratory that allows us to maintain the highest standards of cannabis concentrates by adhering both to Health Canada and FDA pharmaceutical GMP guidelines. That ensures product safety, quality, and efficacy, which is consistent with the Aphria brand and commitment to excellence."
0,"With the organization in place and commercial launch plans underway, we are well positioned for success in 2018. We secured $10 million in private equity financing that meaningfully fortifies our cash resources and allows us to effectively execute our health and nutrition growth strategy. This additional financing will accelerate our commercialization activities and demonstrates our commitment to maximizing value for the food companies, consumers, growers and our shareholders."
0,"With this budget, we expect to resume year-over-year production growth. During 2018, we'll continue to focus on living within cash flow; however, the budget is highly flexible and allows us to make adjustments depending on the direction of commodity prices. Now, I will turn the call back to Ross."
0,"Workspace pipeline is very soft. I think we're   this our SmartView product which allows us to help companies track their occupancy has been very strong and we've had some delighted customers that have had some good word of mouth or they started with one location, now they're starting to go either worldwide or making it standard, and then they're bringing in our scheduling product to even give it more color. So demand is high and then the team has done a very, very nice job."
0,"Yeah, I think, at this point, Mike, we feel confident that we'll be able to meet this demand over the course of the year. And again, to your point on time-sensitive things, that's where we're really focused on prioritizing and making sure those seasonal products, spring seasonal products, for example, that they take priority over other things, that their season is further out."
0,"Yeah, it's   Q5000 is just the 15K. The alliance offering of one contract is for the Q4000, and that allows us to offer a more integrated packages with more services, a one contract approach. So there is an uplift on the Q5000 for the 15K system going out to Q5000 but..."
0,"Yeah, John, that's a good comment. We always want to grow at a rate that allows us to continue our cost leadership position. And we're not really changing the institution of the dividend."
0,"Yeah, our attitude and our approach and our philosophy has not changed. I mean, we see, again the strength that we have which we think differentiates us from others in our marketplace is the vast network that we have that allows us to play in many markets. So we're not just in one or two large markets."
0,"Yeah, sir, thank you for taking my question. Sir, firstly, I wanted to just ask you, this distribution fees that you pay in the B15, you have   I think AMF allows us to pay extra by certain 1%. So, what is that exact number that we are allowed to pay to the distributor in these areas and that is the complete pass-through to the investor, is that understanding correct?"
0,"Yeah, we do not have guidance for FirstNet right now. It does not include what we have put out already and we'll update that to the extent that we get information that will allow us to feel comfortable updating it. I think you make a good point though is that there comes a point that there's typically a lag time between when we get an application in and when we see the revenue from that and that's generally in the six to nine-month timeframe, give or take."
0,"Yeah, we're not doing any lobbying at all, but we will be prepared if that happens. So our operations footprint, design footprint allows us to be very flexible from that perspective."
0,"Yeah, what I would say on that is we certainly adjust also to our market expectations. So as we see opportunity, we want to make sure that we go ahead and live up to that revenue potential in our different areas. However, when we see areas where we may not be performing where we want to be, we want to make sure that we get our cost in alignment with that revenue situation without impacting our long-term capability of delivering our services."
0,"Yeah. I mean, I think just to reiterate what Brian said, I mean, I think as the developing markets, especially as they start moving more towards clean label, I think that will allow us to implement and to deploy some of the technologies we would have in maybe specifically in the U. S."
0,Yeah. It allows us to adequately address that fragmented part of the marketplace...
0,Yeah. So right now the guide that we feel confident in is net retrans in 2018 to be up low-single-digits and for 2019 to be up low-teen percent. So now that we've gotten through those still within the guidance that we gave.
0,"Yeah. So, certainly, we'll have data from the switch study that will allow us to potentially answer that question with data. So patients who have been on eculizumab in the past and then come in and then are randomized to receive ALXN1210 or eculizumab."
0,"Yeah. So, just to explain why we show you product contribution in the slides, it's because that's the way we manage the business, and that allows us to take central costs, manage them centrally, have real visibility into them. And as you know, we think that those costs are too high and it's the way in which we control them and we'll reduce them as part of the restructuring program."
0,"Yeah. Well, we are   we feel confident in those orders, but we are actually going to try to deliver that many vehicles this year. It's a little hard to forecast, you might miss it by a month or two, but we're in that type of timeframe."
0,Yeah. We've got a process in place with the commission that allows us to do it over time. But we would expect it to be done pretty quickly.
0,"Yes, it does and let me walk through what our current plans are. Obviously, because this is still   DEXYCU is in the ophthalmology space, one of the key advantages of course is that it allows us to leverage the majority of the infrastructure that we currently have and the infrastructure that we will be building out on the commercial side. For example, marketing, operations   sales operations, a lot of the back office functions that we need to have, the compliance, the training, et cetera."
0,"Yes. Yeah, we feel confident that we will see a gradual improvement in our assortment this year compared to last year. Yes."
0,"You add a spattering of 20% to 30% conversions into that number, which we think we have consistently delivered at that level or above. And I think I would say to you, we feel confident that what we laid out at our Analyst Day over a year ago of being in that 6% to 7% range over the next few years is readily achievable, and I would argue sort of a lot of it is already in gestation."
0,"You buy a company that generates more cash and use that to buy the next company, while always making internal investments. But these companies just generates so much cash that it allows us to deploy, continuing to grow. And as we mentioned, we expect to do about $7 billion of M&A over the next four years."
0,"You can see very clearly the broad spread of our portfolio and the high level of geographic diversification. Our experience in infrastructure in the various countries in which we operate allows us to maintain long-term customer relationships and strong local content and management. Since the Q3 call, there has been no change in rig numbers."
0,"You have to get them, they have to design to you and then get into the models of cameras. But that is how we outgrow the market is by either organically increasing served market areas or inorganically buying something that allows us to get into a new served market. You cannot continually have organic growth that outgrows a market growth."
0,"You may also know that, from last year, this is a reasonably   other than moving of the bonus, it's a reasonably predictable cash flow for us. It just allows us to focus on generating cash flow for the year and to focus on delivering results on revenue and EBITDA by the quarter."
0,"You put that program in Washington, in LA, in New York and you would have had a large program. So, it was actually the impetus for us to develop the data analytics that now allows us to say we want to do that degree at that university because we're confident it will scale. So, that's the only one that we've ever written off."
0,"You're exactly right. Your memory's on top of things as always, because we used to have a lot of riders and trackers and the like, and what that does, you're right, the benefit to us is it minimize the regulatory lag and it kind of allows us to deploy the capital for the customer benefit much faster. The benefit to the commission is you do not have pancake rate cases all across, and so you don't create that workload or backlog over there at the Commission."
